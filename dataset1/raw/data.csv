"Non silly answer: Just ask your partner if there's anything they'd like for you to do to them while they blow you.

Example: I know I'm in a minority here but I personally *hate* having my hair touched/played with. Don't like having my head pushed unless its something the guy is into and he asks me if it's ok first. In my case i prefer a guy that lays back and enjoys it, maybe occasionally stroking my cheek if he really wants something to do (presumably if it's a position with limited access to the rest of me)

"Aware this was directed at men, but my boyfriend and I deal with the same thing. We're long-distance, and his sex drive is definitely higher than mine. I wouldn't say it's a mutual point of contention whatsoever; he has never been the one to ever decline an advance or ""ignore the horny,"" but I'm obviously not always in the mood. It's hard, especially since we're not physically with each other. I feel guilty about not being able to ""put out"" when he needs me to, but I have periods of sex repulsion and am more often than not in a place where I simply cannot engage in such activities, emotionally. I hate denying him and don't want to be ""that"" girlfriend, but pushing myself to do that stuff when I just cannot always hurts me. I know he watches porn too, which I really cannot get mad at (as much as I hate it) because why wouldn't he if I'm not helping out. He's the love of my life and this is in no way a dealbreaker for me, but it's still really hard.

"I've been with my girlfriend for close to 6 years now. In the beginning we were very much at the same level when it came to sex, though for various reasons, one being locked up for some time in the pandemic, her drive has lowered considerably to the point where we have had sex I think twice since January 2020. 

I consider myself to have a fairly high sex drive, and it's been a difficult pill to swallow, but I love the girl and am putting in the work to support her and help her as there is a lot of stress and anxiety in her life right now, and she is living away from family, so moods are often low. I know the danger of expectation, that her feeling better when she is in a better headspace and that possibly leading to increased sex drive, but I feel like I need to try.

"If it's always not a good time for it, you could try planning it out, don't let it be spontaneous anymore. Try have a discussion and pick a frequency you are both happy with, and mark it on the calendar. Once the day is approaching, decide when it will happen, Friday night dinner and drinks out out somewhere then come home, long sleep in Sunday together, cook a meal together next Monday and go to bed early together.

If the desire is gone altogether, then I dunno. Either way, you need to discuss it with her, sometime neutral, not right after a rejection.",/r/AskMen/comments/qnoo2r/men_whose_love_of_your_lifepartner_has_a/hjiuqys/,bendito24,male

Edit: There is a happy ending here.

"There is actually a great article about this I read about the other day, really opened my eyes to fully exerting myself if I want to be happy. Whether women are attracted to me or not, doesn’t matter, Imma do me and live this life. Its ridiculous what people ask of men today but don’t want to listen to our side of the story. Men have been workhorses for thousands of years due to our potential physical ability, you take that away or decide they have no voice and cut all of our wages in hopes they’ll all shackle up to women in the workforce who then decide your wage isn’t enough anymore and only try to date the ultra rich. Women have contemplated their existence and “is this really it?” Since the first world war, read “The Feminine Mystique.” They’ve been given tranquilizers and now SSRI’s in the modern era for their depression that likely stems from the current model of our world as complete and utter crap. We have to reenvision it and work towards. But continuing to dismantle men’s voices, our rights, and kill away our marriages, mental health, and friendships will keep us apart and weak. More needs to be done, but like I said, no one will listen or you’ll be drowned out by the internet police or misinformed radicals claiming we are misogynistic.

"Not necessarily. A guy can only provide companionship, friendship, love, and emotional support if you're able to carve out time to spend together. If both people are busy, career driven/type A work focused people, it can become difficult to have quality time together without interruptions.

Truth is, not everyone wants to be a power couple because that combination creates a relationship dynamic that doesn't appeal to everyone.

Similarly, I seek out people who are laid back because they tend to complement my own personality. As long as the guy is working and is financially stable, I don't care about his level of success.

I certainly wouldn't eliminate a guy for being successful/career driven...but I see it as a possible complication rather than solely being a benefit.

"*The One*. (Came here to say the ‘love of my life’.)

My *first* love would also be cool - but I don’t think our paths would have stayed converged for too long. She lives back in our home-area more or less, and I’m infinitely more happy living where I do now, and she’s been a parent for 3 or 4 years - I’m only starting to get used to the idea...

The *middle* love (maybe thats a name for it) was even more definitely not right for me long term, is also married already, and lives in a place I have no desire to visit, let alone live. Even though I consider this the most successful, fulfilling, fun relationship of my life to date. It is ok that it ended, we had a great time.

But my *most recent* love... and I hesitate to use that word, as it was a short period of time - but I’m afraid deep down I will never feel as strongly for someone again, as I did for her. In some ways it’s almost freeing, to know I met my ‘perfect person’ and now I don’t have to worry about not finding the ‘right one’ - but at the same time, it is the most depressing thing I’ve ever felt - that I know she doesnt feel the same about me... and even if her mind could change, she wants “no connection” to me... It is soul-crushingly devastating. (I have even met another person who is very cool, very recently... but I’m afraid all others will forever be eclipsed by *The One*.",/r/AskMen/comments/qmm6r1/if_someone_gave_you_a_box_of_everything_you_have/hjc1ei4/,Indlvarn,male

There is no ""*the* right one"", there is only *a* good match. This idea of soul mates, that there is one singular person out there who is perfect for you and if you choose someone else you are doing it wrong has caused immense damage. 

For the vast majority of men, there are hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of women out there with a combination of personality, temperament, character, attractiveness, communication style, etc. that match well enough with the man's that they could live happy lives together.

"I simply constantly want my life to get *better*, and I know that's entirely on me.

 I've had 2 close friends over the years. One is living on social security, a depressed alcoholic, pretty much schizophrenic, and negative. The other is a CEO, workaholic, very grounded and positive. It all comes down to attitude.

I could fill a book with all the adjustments I've made over the years: emotional release and healing, stopping playing video games (like the other commenter), exercised, gratitude, & on & on & on.

But currently I'm on this: whatever it is, from dating to career to friends, focus on happiness. What have been your favorite things to do, friends to have, and people to date? Why? Start figuring out and honing in on what makes you happy.

Then set goals. Goals produce dopamine. It kind of doesn't matter how realistic the goal is. But once you set a goal, even if it seems impossible, your brain will start trying to figure it out. It could take days, weeks, months, years, or decades. But your brain will start finding a way.

But every goal must be something you find joy in. Every person you date, job you take or make, every sport you play must uplift you in some way. That's the key to elevation.",/r/AskMen/comments/qn1osp/men_who_have_rejected_their_past_and_moved/hjde9l4/,p1mpleton,male

"I'm working on making that change right now after a very difficult last 2 years for many reasons. While a lot of people have mentioned giving up things, I think that's incorrect. However, you need to prioritize the things that you see as the way to improve your life. I wouldn't recommend giving up on a hobby, as some have said video games, if it's something you enjoy. You have to have hobbies to make life worth living. you can't always be working and driving to the next thing. Because what happens when you get to that thing? what then? you have to enjoy the journey to that thing as well as the destination. The only exception to this is if you're in a bad or desperate situation that you need to get out of immediately.",/r/AskMen/comments/qn1osp/men_who_have_rejected_their_past_and_moved/hjdi71c/,BenderB-Rodriguez,male
"Not everyone is as masochistic as Goggins. Some people are fine playing video games. But I was into violent games, and they're proven to weaken willpower.

My 2 friends had great childhoods, but radically different adulthoods. One went from that childhood to a pretty chill adulthood, to where the CEO job is actually one of the most difficult times in his life, though he's super chill and positive, considering.

The other friend has a long list of sht that's all some of the worst things that can happen: alcoholic abusive husband, multiple auto accidents including getting hit while she was *parked in a parking space*, drug addict son dying in his 30's of an accidental overdose, a rare medical condition, and a long list of these. It's like every time she starts feeling a little better, life gives her some gnarly setback again. It's possible she'd be more positive if she wasn't routinely getting slammed with life-altering traumatic events.

I don't think everyone gets the same amount of control over their attitude as the next person, but if you have any power over it, it's best to use it.

About violent video games, the study I read just left out candy, and told participants not to eat it. There were exponentially more likely to eat it while playing video games. Could be the violence, the immediate gratification, or who knows. There is a connection between people who can favor long-term rewards over short-term.

In an effort to salvage that relationship, saw another therapist who told me not to have anxiety about anything because we're all going to die someday anyway. Thanks I'm cured.

1. Genuinely less than stellar therapists.  It took me 4-5 total idiots who i dropped within a session or two, before I found one who i ""clicked"" with.  

2. Lack of clear communication on your part.  Therapy gives back whatever you put in.  The quality therapist experience I am referencing was as much about her input as my self-advocacy.  By this I mean- I told her exactly what I wanted to achieve (control over my anger (my daughter was just born and I was a rage monster), a better understanding of why I react so strongly to women yelling, tools for dealing with my spirling moments where I would go from ""fine and dandy"" to ""I want to die"" on a dime, and more).  

She broke each thing I brought up down into component parts, sometimes asking about my childhood, but mainly offering me solutions.  The mediation and breath exercises she gave me transformed by reactions to situations entirely.  

She also helped me learn how to communicate with my wife in a much more healthy way.

This handsome accessory lets you do what no kid without one could do: Carry 3 folders at the same time. No wonder these things are so popular!

Type: accessory
Cannot be traded or discarded
NOTE: You may not equip more than one of these at a time.
NOTE: This item cannot be equipped while in Hardcore. (Except for High School Students)

(In-game plural: over-the-shoulders Folders Holders)


Allows you to insert or remove folders

The player can insert up to three folders into this item to obtain the enchantments provided by each folder. Folder enchantments are listed in order of their folder number.

Removing a folder destroys the folder.

A Folder Holder may not contain multiple identical folders.

Folders in the Holder do persist across ascensions.

Folders from monsters only drop if the Folder Holder is equipped. 

Each folder drop will decrease the drop rate of the next folder.

If owned, this item is automatically pulled at the start of a KOLHS ascension. In KOLHS, its maximum capacity is increased to five folders. 

Upon breaking the prism to end a KOLHS run, if there are more than three folders inside the Holder, the excess folders will be returned to the player's inventory.",/r/AskMen/comments/qms52u/whats_your_favorite_euphemism_for_boobs/hjc8lki/,AndrewIsOnline,male

Doing even basic things like eating alone at a restaurant seemed ludicrous to me, and the first time I tried to do something like that, I ended up going to a double feature by myself. Nearly had a panic attack being there by myself and, while emotionally drained by the end, felt good that I could do something actually normal.

"For men? 


No one is going to come save you. 


You need to be self reliant, and have a plan, always. Women are different in this aspect. Women always have the option to be self reliant if they want. But they can also get pregnant, and be a housewife if the situation is right. We don't have that option. 


So, there is no easy way out for men. Unless you're a trust fund kid or you got really lucky along the way. Maybe a woman supports you, and you're a stay at home dad. That's fine. But it's not the case for most men. 


The solution to this is to set goals. Pursue things that you know you're great at, and become even BETTER at those things. It's never been easier to hustle and make money in the world than it is today. If you take something that you're naturally good at, and amplify the fuck out of it, you can succeed. 

And don't say there's nothing you're good at. Everyone is good at something. If for some odd reason you have never acquired some sort of skill that you're good at, then you need to research and educate yourself on something until you ARE good at it. There are tons of ways to do this. College is one. But trade schools are an even better idea. Trade schools can teach you skill and get you certified. These jobs are not exactly glamorous, but they can make a ton of money. Think about the last time you called the electrician and how much that shit costs. 

 But you have to be driven, and you have to set the bar really high for yourself. You're going to fail a few times, but you have to keep going. No matter what path you take. It's not easy. It's not getting any easier.

"What do you think about the idea that every man has the ""hero instinct""?
This was a phrase coined by a dating coach and basically the idea is that a man's deepest primal instinct (not sex, not getting money, not getting food) is basically the desire to be a hero in his life and those close to him.

I'm not sure I buy into this, mainly because it's something that was created by a dating coach but I read years ago How to Win Friend and Influence People and basically everyone wants to feel important and special. I think our society expects men to be productive so I see being a hero as a way to be productive. 

I don't know but don't guys want to feel like they are valued just because of who they are? Why do we promote women having value just for existing but we aren't allowing men to feel this way. Why do they have to be something to feel important? We're all humans so shouldn't that be enough?",/r/AskMen/comments/qmvaa9/what_do_you_think_about_the_idea_that_every_man/,LogicalDocSpock,female
"From the guys I know at least (and myself), yeah we want to be valued just because of who we are. But also that just doesn't happen that much. Instead we see from a young age that the whole ""productive"" thing is really what you have to do, so you learn to want that instead. And to add on, being productive (or doing the hero thing) can be its own reward too. You do something you think is good and it gets done. It's nice to see people around you appreciative for what you've done.",/r/AskMen/comments/qmvaa9/what_do_you_think_about_the_idea_that_every_man/hjc59q5/,LithobrokenPenguin,male
"That's why we enjoy fixing things, whether it's a machine or someone's bad day at work. It's in our nature to do something worthwhile and helpful. How that manifests is of course different for every man depending on a thousand different factors. 

So that ""hero instinct"" really isn't a hero instinct, it's the simple drive that says ""I can take care of that"". Whether we're appreciated for it is a whole different story.",/r/AskMen/comments/qmvaa9/what_do_you_think_about_the_idea_that_every_man/hjc4w0d/,scotiej,male
"I think everyone has something similar, but I believe in the Primal Needs.

While our beliefs and values amongst human beings are different, the primal needs that we have are universal.  We are all driven by these primal needs that have been encoded in our DNA for ages.

"I don’t know if it counts for other men and if it excludes women, but I do sometimes have the desire to be a hero. Not that literal, but being able to do something for someone because that person can’t or has a hard time with it feels nice. I think a very common one is opening a jar in a situation where the girl has trouble opening it. In some sense you are the ‘hero’ at that moment.",/r/AskMen/comments/qmvaa9/what_do_you_think_about_the_idea_that_every_man/hjctk38/,untakenname3,male
"I think the reason men have that instinct is for the sex and other rewards. I mean the saving someone from some accident or burning building is a common one for men at least that I know of. 

But why? Bc people would be like omg it’s that guy! And then interviews and blah blah blah. It’s not a direct reward but it would lead to a total jerking off of the ego and also generally being treated better. Plus I think literal jerking off from women. Or at least it’d be a great pick up line or way to tip the convo

I think we all overestimate how much would come from it though. People seem to forget (even when it’s made a big deal of at the time to a specific person) people who give or risk their lives to save others.

"Is it weird to realize I would probably such a duck for less but probably not for 1 billion?

First of all, until there are trillionaires I doubt anyone with billions would offer to add another billionaire to the ranks. Even Bezos and Gates ex-wives did not marry billionaires so it can't be said they sucked a sick for a billion dollars.

Second of all, I won't ever see that money. Provided the agreement is made in good faith, there will likely be a loophole, see point one. If there isn't a loophole, I won't be collecting without litigation which at best will bankrupt me and at worst I'll be arrested for prostitution or something.

Third, supposing the second point is false and I deposit one billion into my account. Am I going to live long enough to use any of the money? Am I going to end up blowing it all on surveillance and security to remain alive? Will I simply be kidnapped and tortured until the money is returned?

I mean, the only scenario where this is possible is if I had a genie negotiating the whole thing and even then I don't trust the monkey's paw type possibilities.

">leaving the dream

Hmmm

>Though many of the subjects are interesting, I just feel like it is school work

That's because it is. Work is vastly different from school.

I chose the right career in software engineering, and I also studied computer science with a focus on software engineering. I knew as a kid that this is what I wanted to do, and have been programming when other kids were still outside playing. That's to say I always knew that this was the only path. And now in my early 30s, it's more evident than ever.

And yet, the curriculum was hard and there were many subjects I did not like that I had to power through. It was a lot of learning, and school work, as you put it. Don't get me wrong, I loved the overall experience and connected with so many people who now work in the industry. But even in the case where the path is clearly laid out in front of you, it still felt like you feel your curriculum is feeling now.

I also started working full time at age 19 while studying. There is some overlap, but for the most part, you learn to work in your job once you start your job. Every job is different and you need to learn new things to do that job. School is there to provide the foundation, but also to evaluate you. Most degrees don't actually enable you to work. They just prove that if need be, you can cram anything and do something with that. Readiness of mind and apprehension.

My point is: You haven't chosen a career yet, but even if you did, you'd probably feel the same way right now. It's important that you push through and finish. After that, you can plan your next step and finally start a career... wherever that might be.",/r/AskMen/comments/qmu3df/what_are_some_key_signs_that_you_chose_the_wrong/hjbyf81/,GYN-k4H-Q3z-75B,male

Brisket is my favorite, but the thing I end up sharing with people the most is smoked turkey on Thanksgiving (which I highly recommend people try, it clears out a ton of room in the kitchen for people working on sides and gives you an excuse to avoid the other work and sit outside drinking and smoking cigars for the whole day leading up to the meal.)",/r/AskMen/comments/qmd9wa/what_dish_can_you_cook_best/hj95g0r/,Griffin880,male

"Essentially the exact same setup as the WSM, just a slightly different bottom vent. My dad and brother both have offset smokers and they seem vastly more convenient, I just don't have the space in my yard or to store it.

For my rub it varies by what I'm cooking, but generally it tends to be heavy on the brown sugar and paprika. I don't want it to be too sweet, but the brown sugar tends to give me a good crust, so the paprika helps dull the sweetness a little.

I also use a marinade and/or injection based around oil, lemon/vinegar, and cayenne pepper. I use the same recipe to baste it towards the end but I add salt to it at that point. I don't know the recipe off hand because my dad made a video of him making it early into cell phone video being a thing and it's maybe the funniest shit I've ever seen, my mom is working as the camera man, at one point the camera gets blasted with marinade while it's being injected.

"We work like fedex/ups in a sense that we handle a variety of freight that's direct to customer from the shipper. 

So I work a hybrid shift where I handle both outbound and inbound freight. The freight we work with is less than truckload so we load as many shipments as we can into a trailer to get the most bang for the buck. 

On the outbound part, I help load our trailers that head to another service center for unloading/relay everything from our local customers and the surrounding areas that is headed to other parts of the US. 

On the inbound half I help unload trailers filled with freight destined for local customers and since we're an end of the line terminal we generally don't crossload or split breakers.

"Ok so this might be long but here it goes:

1. Ask questions to the guy - both personal as well as wild ones to get to know them (What would you do if you had to kill a human to cure cancer sort of questions)
2. Be interested and show enthusiasm - meaning, do not reply with just one word answers. Make your answers elaborate and descriptive.
3. Make sure that your profile is clear of your intentions and for the love of god - don't post any group pics. We just want to know who you are and not have to guess which one you are.
4. You got pets? Great - talk about those and make sure to show them.
5. Has the conversation gone stale? Engage in a difficult question (example as point 1) - there are tonnes of articles that can help in this via Google. It is fine that the guy isn't initiating the conversation (however there is a limit which I'll explain further down)
6. Talk about your childhood - you'd be surprised at how many things in common you would have if you're from the same age gap.
7. Do NOT play games - hard to get, cold shoulder, dramatic etc etc. Just don't. 
8. Jokes - both the clean and the naughty ones are fun and even if you do a few innuendos. But don't overly do it and of course, I hope that no douche bag over extends on this or takes it another way.

I think these are the top most things that come to mind. Like I said in point 5 though, even though it's great that you initiate the conversation, so should the guy. Both of you should be able to carry a conversation so what I've written to you also applies to whoever you're speaking with.

"Yes. 

Right before starting college, I began a relationship that lasted all four years. We broke up a couple months after graduation. She went to a different school, and I spent all my weekends with her. I made very few new friends in college and missed out on the whole experience because I just went to class and then went to see my girlfriend. 

I made up for some of it after we broke up, but then I dated someone else a few years later. I wasn't even that into her - I just got kinda desperate because I'd been getting shut down by girls I really liked and I thought I couldn't do better.

Both of those relationships lasted longer than they should have, but breaking up was always something that terrified me, so I just went through the motions.

I really think I would have had more fun if I'd just focused on myself instead of being so concerned with relationships.

3) if you want babby and she doesn’t, you need to walk away from the relationship and go find someone to impregnate

What men’s rights nonsense have you been reading? Feminists who have sex with men love birth control. They love dramatically reducing the possibility of getting pregnant when they didn’t want to (which could at worst kill them and at best often destroys their career prospects or leaves them with the trauma of abortion or adoption) every time they have sex. They are generally all for better access to birth control and free condoms/men taking equal responsibility in birth control.,/r/AskMen/comments/qls9rc/is_it_true_when_they_say_guys_will_never_get_to/hj727tb/,halfadash6,female
"There is a difference between the two. Women have to go through the actual work and risk of growing another person inside of them and then pushing said person out. So yeah, they get the final say on whether or not they keep the pregnancy. It’s not fair, but life isn’t fair. Being pregnant and giving birth sucks and I’d bet almost anything that the majority of men would not take on that burden even if that meant they got the right to choose. Wanting to be able to decide whether your partner stays pregnant is the epitome of having your cake and eating it too. 

And that being said, that doesn’t negate the idea that people should be discussing their wants and be on the same page with their partner. The very large majority of people who are pro choice also agree that unwanted pregnancies should be avoided as much as possible/we should have comprehensive sex ed and free birth control for all.

Plus dealing with children all day sounds really miserable to me, I don't particularly like spending time with children which is probably the real reason I think teaching is such a hard job, and that's even before having to deal with the parents which given some of the horror stories I've heard are worse than dealing with the kids.

"Being dirt poor in the USA.  When I was poor I had to constantly work for no pay.  Go to medicaid, do paperwork all day, sit in an office where you're not allowed to eat, talk or text on phone or drink anything for 8 hours waiting for someone to tell you you are missing one tiny document or something. Then reject you, and you have to do it all over again 3 times.  Making you have to deal with medicaid for like 40 hours in one month.  Having to do constant applications for basic human needs.  Trying to get a shelter bed.  spending 20 hours per week in group therapy groups, then having to go to 20 hours a week of jobs program that teaches you absolutely nothing except to tell you there are a ton of jobs and you're  the reason you don't have one yet.  dealing with the public mental health and medical system. So if you want a dentist, you gotta wait in a 7 hour line to get an appointment to see a student and then just getting a damn filling will take 10 visits cause the student is having to do an assessment and get that checked, then a cleaning, then a deep clean that takes 3 visits, then finally the filling which they messed up and you have to have done again.

The G‐spot has a distinguishable anatomic structure that is located on the dorsal perineal membrane, 16.5 mm from the upper part of the urethral meatus, and creates a 35° angle with the lateral border of the urethra. The lower pole (tail) and the upper pole (head) were located 3 and 15 mm next to the lateral border of the urethra, respectively. Grossly, the G‐spot appeared as a well‐delineated sac with walls that resembled fibroconnective tissues and resembled erectile tissues. The superior surface of the sac had bluish irregularities visible through the coat. Upon opening the sac's upper coat, blue grape‐like anatomic compositions of the G‐spot emerged with dimensions of length (L) of 8.1 mm × width (W) of 3.6–1.5 mm × height (H) of 0.4 mm. The G‐spot structure had three distinct areas: the proximal part (the head) L 3.4 mm × W 3.6 mm, the middle part L 3.1 mm × W 3.3 mm, and the distal part (tail) L 3.3 mm × W 3.0 mm.

Crazy, right? That's where I realized I was going wrong if I wanted to get any kind of response. Except being that guy bothered me. It was not genuine.  It was manipulative.

"I'm saying they DO know what they want, at least in theory. It's just that the reality of it isn't half as exciting as what they've built up in their mind.

">So you think women are uniquely incapable of resisting ""exciting"" things that are bad for them?

No, but I do think that women are in the unique position of being actively pursued by exciting things that are bad for them. If I was in that position I would do the same. For example, If I had 10 new messages a day on a dating site and 1 of these was from a hot young woman, I'd go for the hot one every time. I might not even read the 9 other messages at all.  Even if she seemed a little high maintenance/vapid. I'd probably tell my myself things like ""Oh, she's probably just acting that way but is really cool/interesting deep down."" I could totally see myself doing that over and over again hoping that I'll hit the jackpot and the find the one who actually is really cool on top of being smoking hot.

That's not to suggest that women are necessarily valuing ""hot"" the same way I would. I'm just relating to what I would personally consider exciting but bad for me.

But that's now how it is for me and most other guys. We just cast a wide net and see what we can get. There are no exciting things pursuing us.  Go through these questions on askmen. Every time a woman posts something like ""how would you like a girl to approach you?"" Every other comment is like ""what do you mean? that doesn't happen."" They're not lying. Yes, it does happen, but only the hottest of hot guys get approached with any regularity. 

\> Maybe you don't understand what they want, and don't see what they see in the guys they're dating -

Maybe not, but I know the end result is that they constantly complain about being manipulated and used for sex.  So whatever they're seeing in these guys is probably more a projection of what they want to see than reality.",/r/AskMen/comments/qmc98u/can_we_seriously_and_calmly_discuss_about_how_to/hjd77tx/,huuaaang,male

Theres a difference (at least, imo) between admiring and finding someone attractive & actively having a 'crush' on them...

If I find someone attractive or interesting, I'll enjoy their company & form a friendship, a crush is someone I'd active start a relationship with given the opportunity.

"Frankly, this doesn't sound healthy on either side of the fence.

On the one hand:

>I'm furious and find this really disrespectful of him. We're together for only a few months and he already develops a crush on someone else?

He doesn't get to choose who he's attracted to, any more than you do. So this is kind of an unreasonable attitude. A healthy relationship requires both partners to be open and forgiving and supportive, and to commit to each other despite temptations; expecting people not to *have* any temptations isn't realistic.

But on the other hand:

>He cheated on gfs in the past and wants to be honest this time which is cool.

He does? Yeah, really? Statistically speaking, people like this don't usually change. I can see forgiving someone for cheating *once,* when they're young and stupid. But for this guy it sounds like more of a habit than a one-off mistake. Yeah, *maybe* he's really serious about commitment this time, but realistically, I wouldn't expect things to pan out that way.

>the most likely scenario is that he will come home late and drunk tonight.

Is this something he does regularly? Because, I mean, even if we set the whole coworker attraction issue aside, this right here is a big enough problem already.

"You're getting a lot of bad advice in this thread. 

>He started a new job a few days ago and told me today that he has a crush on a co-worker with who he has been flirting at work. He told me after I asked him and suspected something was going on because he was somewhat cold and didn't make physical contact all evening after returning from work. He denied that there was anything wrong but ""confessed"" the next day. He doesn't seem to think it's a big deal because he didn't do anything with her and because ""she's really young"" and that he loves me.

>I was really angry...

Did you ""pry the info out of him"" like so many others in this thread suggested? Or did he expect a tantrum in response to his honesty? And then he told you anyway. 

Every day there's women asking why men don't ""open up."" This is why. You punished him for telling the truth. You punished him for a feeling **that he hadn't acted on.**

>He cheated on gfs in the past **and wants to be honest this time which is cool.**

Is it?

>But I'm furious and find this really disrespectful of him.

Oh, it's not cool.

>I'm so furious right now and keep thinking that I just want to throw him out of the house.

Why are you allowed to be so emotionally out of control and he's expected to not develop a crush on a coworker?

>I don't know what I want right now. Or whether I am over- or underreacting.

Has he been expected to guess what you need?

>He hasn't contacted me and the most likely scenario is that he will come home late and drunk tonight. **Maybe** he will have tried something on with her or developed more feelings for her or **maybe** he will just be sullen or maybe hopeless for the whole relationship (we had some difficult times in the last weeks). 

You've built this all up on your head.

>I just think that running off and crushing on someone at work is not a decent way to sort out issues.

The crush is not the problem. How he responded to it is. He told you, his girlfriend, about it. You responded with anger. And since that's the part that you're admitting to, I imagine what you actually said was worse. 

>Please be honest but kind. I'm not in a good place rn.

You're a grown woman who thinks everyone else should manage your feelings. 

I'm sorry about your grandma passing. I was close with 2 of my grandmothes and they're both gone now. I miss them all the time. I understand that pain. It sounds like you should get some counseling.

">Thanks for the moves, I'll definitly keep them in mind!

Please communicate with her first! Especially with the choking, both because it isn't necessarily what she asked for (she expressed an interest in dominance play, not in breath play) and because it can be dangerous so you both need to understand the risks.

 I have personally had the unfortunate experience of a man choking me in bed without warning/discussion and it was absolutely *terrifying*. So while having a conversation about this stuff may not feel sexy, but it's a lot better than overstepping and doing something sexually that makes her feel unsafe/scared.

>I really don't what to think of the disparity between men and women since I don't have any experience of that kind with women.

Unless she's a bodybuilder or otherwise exceptionally fit, the difference is pretty significant. If you're an average guy, I'd suggest starting with a quarter of your strength and going from there.

By the way - while you're already talking to her about this stuff, maybe ask if she's into being tied up. It's very similar to the desire to be held down (essentially a show of power/control combined with a submission to pleasure) so she might be interested.",/r/AskMen/comments/qm2w7f/how_easy_is_it_for_you_to_holdpin_your_girl_down/hj7mc8y/,zugzwang_03,female
"Not OC, but I've had pretty much this exact conversation with my SO (and in previous relationships).

In my experience, there's definitely a bit of a feeling out period. It's almost guaranteed that you'll need to test things out to understand how much strength you'll need to use - and what moves you're each comfortable with/turned on by. 

There are some really easy ways to start though. Pinning her wrists with your hands (to the bed, to the wall above her head, to the small of her back while she's bent over something) is easy and the chance of you hurting her that way is very small. Similarly, picking her up to reposition her requires more strength but isn't risky as long it doesn't involve making her body bend while she's resisting (the simplest example is just grabbing her hips and pulling her to the edge of the bed; another option is to put your hands under her head and small of back, press her against your body, and roll her on top of/under you).",/r/AskMen/comments/qm2w7f/how_easy_is_it_for_you_to_holdpin_your_girl_down/hj7qona/,zugzwang_03,female

"Mum and dad were at h&m and mum wanted to try on a new mini dress to match with her panties she got for her birthday. She was in the changing room and ""needed help in zipping her dress"" so dad went in and locked the door. He zipped her dress perfectly and said her dress looks gorgeous on her and it just about in line of the bottom of her but cheeks. Mum removed her dress and put on her booty shorts but dad said ""let's try for a baby in here"" which mum replied by sitting down lowering her shorts and pulling her panties to the side. Dad pulled down his pants and boxers with a semi hard dick. He was gently caressing her pussy brushing her clit a few times. He gently slipped both his fingers inside finding that one spot which he did when he saw her twitch. He then tapped the top of her pussy and mum covered her mouth to avoid making noise but her legs started shaking and she was breathing more heavily. Dad felt a very tight grip of his fingers inside mum and decided to rub his dick on mum's labia. Mum being desperate to get it inside, she put it in and wrapped her legs around dad's waste. He loved that warm feeling inside her and thrusted slowly. Mum whispered her to go a bit faster so he did until he made mum cum again. He kept that rhythm until dad found a climax and came deep inside her, ropes of cum shot inside mum, mum's body was shaking out of control feeling waves upon waves of orgasm while dad made some last waves of orgasm left to makes a couple of hard thrusts. Both were breathing heavily and once dad pulled out he had to open really wide to see the cum so he closed her pussy as quickly as possible and mum put her panties back into position. She pulled up her booty shorts, adjusted her tube top while dad also got dressed and left the changing room. The shop assistant said "" The zip on the dress must have been a tough one to pull up"" mum replied ""but it was worth it"". We went to pay for the dress and the sales assistant complimented my mum's glowing face. Mum spent all day walking with me inside her then at the end of the day she took a pregnancy test and found out she was pregnant. They were so happy hugging each other and started making a shopping list of baby items to buy.

Like, that's manipulative as fuck.  If you don't want to sleep with a girl on the first date, then *don't fucking pursue sex with her on the first date*.

And I stand by what I said when I called his behavior ""manipulative"", because I'm pretty sure that he didn't stop and warn the lady, ""oh yeah, I'm going to try putting the moves on you heavy, but if you give in and sleep with me, I'm going to judge you for being too easy and never call you again.""

Gym stuff? I buy whatever is cheap. I go to the outlet store and buy the cheapest shirts and shorts I possibly can. I'm there to lift weights, not win a fashion contest. 


Shoes are important!! I used to buy cheap shoes, for years. Because I didn't care. But Asics, New Balance, and Doc Martens are worth the money. I'll never buy cheap shoes again. 

Dress clothes is another thing all together. I went last year and got some nice fitted stuff from a couple of high end stores. I think it's worth it for special occasions.

"It's not really hate but more a kind of disappontment in how I reacted and 'solved' problems back then.

I used to be the class clown most of the time and went along well with other kids my age. Had my share of bad apples I hung out with but nevertheless, I never caught on their bad habits.

One key mistake I made was both letti g my parents dress me for a school dance and leaving my date by herself and going back home without a word.

At the time, I ""thought"" people thought my attire was ridiculous and believed the only way to not let my date get ridiculed along with myself was to run away.

Thing is, the other kids probably didn't care and neither did she surely and I was the only one to believe it was the case.

It cost me my self-esteem (I became a loner recluse till the end of high school, refusing to speak to anyone) and lost a precious friendship with a girl I admitedly had a crush on at the time.

So for a long time, my solution to problems was to run away from them, thinking I was powerless to do anything about it because it simply was who I was.

Even when I broke out of my cocoon, so to speak, I still retained that habit of running away from problems instead of facing them. It is a habit that I still struggle with these days though my ego just jumps in and kicks my ass mentally to own up to mistakes now. It just takes a while but I end up working up the courage to face them... most of the time.

"Mack Weldon underwear has been by far the best I've gotten, and I've been through quite a few of the luxury underwear brands. These things never get loose, not throughout the day or over time. Very supportive too.

Also balls to the front makes sense given where they are on our body; they are on the front side of our bodies, not directly under us.

Some of the most supportive underwear is going to be a dance belt which is meant for gymnasts/dancers/circus artists/etc to secure everything in place so it doesn't get hit or twisted. It puts everything up front though. Also generally worn by any dudes in spandex to give a generic super hero bulge instead of a camel tail.

"Ok I can see your 20's with my own.

Homeless living in a Red Cross Shelter/ No Car so I had to bike to my job/I was security for a minor drug dealer/ Cared more about getting my next PoA than trying to settle down because I was in my 20's and living my life.

The wake up call was when 6 Guys were looking for me to kill me. I was living in a condemned building but it was better than the shelter and I had my own room. Word got around that I was the muscle for my buddy so the guys that had beef with him wanted to take me out first. They came onto my college campus looking for me but I was tipped off and ran. 

I finally figured out that I wasn't going to make it to my 30's if I didn't change.

I talked to a recruiter at 29 yrs old and enlisted. I was too old for the AirForce, Grew up in and around the Army and knew better than to join the Marines due to the sheer amount of running and exercise those poor bastards have to do so I picked the NAVY. I lost 20 pounds to be able to enlist by running and lots and lots of Cabbage soup. 

I knew I wanted college so every thing I had went into the GI Bill and the Navy College fund etc etc I even started saving bonds to pay for it later. 4 yrs later after going from Deck SeaMan ( Grunt Worker, chips paint/pushes brooms/ drives the ship and generally dogsbody) to I.T. and learning about PC techs and Server management I chose to continue in the IT field. I got a degree in Networking, got my Certs in A+/Net+/Sec+/CASP/CCNA and now make well over 120+ per year. I own a home and a rental property( ya never really shake off the fear of being homeless again) a 3 yr old Truck and have savings and investments as well as a retirement fund. As far as relationships go, they're not for me. I tired but the thought of settling down with one person makes me ill when there's so many willing holes out there to fill. 

I did it by having a plan and you can too. Its not too late to join up and get some life experience under your belt.

"The good news is, it is never too late to change. The bad news is, the older we get, and the longer we hold onto habits, the harder it is to change. But you can do it. Just make sure you do it in manageable ways. 

I would recommend that you make a list of goals. Physical, professional, and personal. These goals should be big goals like get your degree, get married, work for Disney etc. Then break the goals down to steps and habits. That is where real change takes place. You don't work really hard for a few weeks and become super fit. You adapt your eating goals and your exercise goals to get fitter over time and continue that fitness even after you reach your goals. 

Then find friends and mentors who can check in on you and encourage your behavior. Ideally you find a gym buddy or a study buddy for school etc. Someone with aligned goals. Part of change can be hard if those around you are holding you back, or don't want you to change. I had to leave a decent roommate situation because they were content with their lives. Which is fine, but I wanted to go to grad school, and get promoted and that meant studying in evenings and it caused conflict. So surrounding yourself with those in alignment, can make a difference. 

There is a lot more to it. Definitely read some articles on habit forming and building. Honestly, greatness or even better-ness is small habits that you practice consistently. Drinking 1 less drink a day. Jogging a mile every day. Something is better than nothing.

Consenting adults can choose to have sex or enter a relationship for many reasons. There is no reason to assume predatory behavior is an inherent part of 2 adults making that decision.

As far as I can tell there are a couple of reasons you would make this assumption:

1. You infantilize women and don't see them as having agency.

2. You think all sex is some sort of transaction, in which someone's status (financial, social, etc) is traded for the other person's body.

"Honestly, it'd been dead silent on the compliment front for a very long time until I received not one, not even two but THREE whole, genuine compliments last week! Two on the SAME DAY! (sorry for incoming long comment)

The first was a friend of a friend telling me I had 'really beautiful eyes' that looked like 'honey in a forest of oak' (might be paraphrasing, can't remember the exact adjective or type of wood she mentioned). As someone who has naturally darker and slightly discoloured teeth, along with a bad case of acne, to hear such a beautiful comment about my face really opened up a lot in my head. I've probably thought about it a thousand times since.

The second was a casual compliment from a male friend who's gay, who said I was 'kinda cute' and that 'he would definitely look twice if he knew I wasn't straight already'. It was a bit awkward, especially because he's not great at wording certain things, but I understood and seriously appreciated it. As a disabled person, I struggled against prejudice from the media and my family that people who has disabilities 'weren't desirable'. To hear that someone else found me attractive even in a small way was and is still doing wonders for my confidence.

The third was a long-time female friend, who complimented my 'empathy and wisdom' and compared me to Otis from the show *Sex Education.* I'm a huge fan of the show and really resonate with Otis: my social awkwardness makes it hard to make new friends, and I try as hard as I can to help out and keep close with my current friends. I often get told I'm 'smart' but I think being empathetic and having an emotional rapport with a good friend is the greater compliment. It really solidified my self-worth as a person and friend.

"Mental/emotional/probably sexual abuse. The last 6 months I lived with my ex, I was super depressed. I could barely function, couldn't really find joy in anything, and I'm not proud of this, but when he was out on his motorcycle, I wished that he wouldn't make it home. I couldn't relax when he was around, I had to anticipate what might set him off. When something did, I had to fix it. I had to pull him out of his bad moods. But I couldn't just be all ""turn that frown upside down"", I had to join him in his bad mood so he knew I was taking it seriously. Then pull myself into a good mood so I could pull him into one too. Then have sex with him. Ugh, I forgot how exhausting he was until I typed all this out.

And that's not even mentioning how things were always my fault and never his, and I had to compromise in disagreements but he never did. A couple months before I left, I had the terrible realization that if he hit me, I would've blamed myself. Thankfully he never did, but still.

My only regret is ever giving him a chance in the first place. And not reading The Gift of Fear before I met him. That book honestly could've saved me from getting into that situation.

I am definitely happier now. But to be fair, the bar for that is basically on the ground.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qntb1j/why_did_you_get_divorced/hjiwmgh/,clockworkbird,female

"I'm a very religious person. It was difficult to convince myself that it was okay to leave, even though he was treating me horribly, because I thought the Bible said you could only get a divorce for adultery or abandonment. He was obsessed with his female coworker but I didn't believe they were sleeping together.

This was the verse that convinced me it was okay to leave:

""If [a man] marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights. If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money."" Exodus 21:10-11

He wasn't formally married to his co-worker, but he might as well have been. He was spending all of his time with her and all of our money on her while neglecting me, his pregnant wife. This verse showed me that there was such a thing as ""constructive divorce"" in God's eyes, that God cares if a husband is making it hard for his wife to eat. 

My views on divorce and the Bible are more liberal now, but as a relatively conservative woman at the time, that was what set me free.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qntb1j/why_did_you_get_divorced/hjjqizz/,Ms_Rarity,female

"Too many years living with manipulation, lies, emotional and financial abuse, increased drug use from his part and an overall lack of decency, respect and willingness to be better.

"You might react incorrectly the first time, there's no way to know really. When the argument's over, ask her what she wants you to do if it happens again.

In the moment, see how she's reacting to her own tears. If she's angry at herself for crying do NOT comfort her, just ask if she wants to come back to the conversation later. From experience I get super angry that I'm crying which makes me cry more. I get angry that I can no longer articulate what I want to say and the other person ends up winning the argument because they're the only one who can still talk in complete sentences.

If you're not into me, I don't want to date you, and I won't hold that against you.  But they feel like that opinion makes them shallow, so instead they'll say ""I want to date an active healthy person because I like to play a lot of sports and value health and fitness.""  And I'm like, dude, I play 11 hours of sports a week, and compete in powerlifting at a national level.  That's not suddenly going to make my thighs look less like a nylon stocking full of grapes, and knowing that information isn't going to make you more interested in my lumpy body.

I'm just invisible. My husband and most of the people I consider friends were people who I met online or in an environment where it wasn't optional, like work or school. I don't draw attention at all.

It's a weird state of being, and it's been that way for most of my life but especially at the times when I was more out of shape or tried less hard. I was probably at my ""best"" in my early 20s, and once in a while I'd get some male attention, but it wasn't much or often.

"I agree with this. Growing up, I was constantly aware of the stigma of my looks. I knew the research and how people would talk about people like me, so I used that as my excuse to be defensive. I was very bitter about it, especially as a teenager. Looking back, there were definitely opportunities for friendships and romances that I pushed away because of my insecurities.

Then, something changed and I thought ""what if I just faked it?"" I plastered on a smile and faked being a super outgoing and confident person.

And it worked.

It was crazy to see the difference. I was more approachable, therefore more people approached me. I also had the benefit of working at a job with a ton of ""jocks"" (aka people I would've never approached in high school), which led me to the ""they're just like me"" revelation.

This isn't to say that pretty privilege and bigotry aren't real. They very much are, and I don't want to give the impression that I smiled and suddenly all my problems disappeared. 

There's plenty of nasty stuff that I still have to deal with simply based on my looks. Everything in this thread is real and can't be erased with a positive attitude. I also think that it's become easier as I've grown older and other people have ""lost"" their looks or just become more mature.  

There's definitely some aspect of learned helplessness in life, when you're treated as invisible just for your looks. Again, it's not an imagined reality (there's a reason we ""learn"" this, and it's because the world teaches us), but it can be a vicious cycle of internal reinforcement.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qn5j26/what_are_the_lesser_known_problems_of_being_an/hjf9e5j/,readergrl56,female

"I can't speak for everyone, but personally I knew because:

* I was flat out told by strangers and some ""friends"" that I was either ugly or below average. 

* I was bullied for every aspect of my appearance you could think of - even intimate parts that no one had ever seen - just because people were that repulsed by me.

* My parents would approach compliments and photos differently with me. I was rarely ""beautiful"" or ""pretty"" or whatever like my siblings - I was ""smart"" and ""helpful"" until I had a drastic appearance change that made my face tolerable.

* I was treated differently to my attractive friends. People were less helpful to me, left me out of everything (especially photos), and only wanted me around when it suited them.

* Similarly, double standards based on appearance. E.g. Me being a ""nerd"" was weird and gross, but my attractive friend being a ""nerd"" was hot and cool. Same with glasses, ""edgy"" clothes, wearing cat ears, and so on.

* As weird as it is, I was often the one who got singled out when teachers at school decided to dress code people. I was put in internal suspension because of red hair while pretty girls were walking around with blue, pink, and purple. I also nearly got in trouble for my leather jacket (which pretty girls had gotten away with) until I threatened to wear a purple, furry, floor-length pimp coat since the uniform policy said nothing about that.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qn5j26/what_are_the_lesser_known_problems_of_being_an/hjeurrd/,Ethereal-Glow,female

As an introvert, I find most texting draining, even with close friends, but this is the only way to talk with him (we’re in a LDR) and it often feels different with him. Ideally, I’d like him to initiate (and he does). I like that he responds quickly, even though it felt super weird before we were dating. As we get closer, I hope we keep talking like this, but I’m concerned that there won’t be much to talk about, so maybe it’ll dwindle? Which would be natural.

Two pieces of sunflower seed toast with almond butter and cherry jam (one of his faves)

Two servings of fruit, like today was pineapple chunks and a large grapefruit

Half an avocado

Tea with oatmilk

"A classic example is this scenario:

You are a doctor that provides a life-saving treatment. However there is a limited supply of the treatment and patients enter a cue when they are diagnosed with the illness. There is no skipping in line. As the doctor you have to give the treatment to the next person in the line.

However, your niece, or daughter gets diagnosed but is so ill they will most certainly die before their turn in the queue. Do you follow the rules and keep doing what you're supposed to, or do you risk your job and career to save the life of your loved one?

If you choose to follow the rules, you're using rule-based ethical reasoning. If you choose to save the child, you are using consequence based ethical reasoning.

"I fell down a rabbit hole of how wars affect wildlife, and it is a really odd thing to think about. I mean it is surreal imagining soldiers on a road, fighting, army camps, and then maybe a few kilometres away a snake eating its prey, any big mammalian carnivore chasing down a deer, or birds nesting while gunfire sounds out. But it quite obviously has happened, now and in the past

It also seems quite multifaceted. Fish stocks recovered in the Atlantic when fishing boats were too scared of U-boats to go fishing far from shore in WWII. Mass population displacements mean that farmland became vacant. But at the same time a lot of recent conflicts lead to mass decline of wildlife. War itself is damaging on the environment, and the collapse of law and order, often meant that poaching happened unabated, and militant/rebel/terrorist groups take advantage of the wildlife trade.

"It definitely happened in my first ever relationship. Tl;Dr : I was young and immature. 

I was 18, and the truth is that I wanted to be in a relationship more than I wanted him. He was a good guy, but he was a bit older and very serious about the relationship from the get go, and we weren't actually super compatible. I was infatuated with him and misunderstood that for love. 

I went abroad for a year of exchange abroad, and doing long distance + having to mature on my side made the butterfly go away. And I slowly realized that I had a solid feeling of affection towards him, but maybe not actually romantic love. I kept dating him, and I was trying to get myself to feel the romantic spark for him again, but he wasn't really putting in the effort. I grew frustrated with his lack of actual communication and trying, because I was trying to save the relationship, but he didn't even know that, because really I was the one not communicating properly. 

And just like that, I slowly fell out of love for him and in love with someone else. I didn't act on it, I tried to pretend it wasn't happening. I tried to convince myself that when I would see my boyfriend in person again I'd be able to get the romance back but I hardly believed it myself. And when he came to visit me, I realized I was fully turned off by him, he was give him the ick, I could barely kiss him. So I broke things off.

Most of mine were gifts but I’ve bought a few designer bags for myself.

Otherwise, I suggest looking into popular consignment shops. Buying secondhand is better for the environment, your pocket and giving love to a preloved bag. Brands that are not Louis Vuitton, Hermes or Chanel goes on sale on third-party authorized sellers such as SSENSE. So keep a lookout for those sales. There are also massive designer sales that happen every year if you know where to look. For example in Toronto, The Sample Sale Guys partner with Jimmy Choo, Versace, and more.

"Can’t remember the Dior but it is a canvas clutch so not that much. The Chanel flap bag was “only” €800. Considering these go secondhand for €4000 as well, it was a steal.

For example I had a ‘friend’ that had a friend on campus that he legit only wanted to sleep with that’s it and the lengths he was going to get that chance were sick as hell. Met her parents, learned her interests, she would drive him to his classes, they would go on dates. He told me he genuinely just wanted to sleep with her and he was serious too. It was sick as hell and I tried hard to get her contact info because I wanted to tell her badly but I never could. I ended up ghosting him a year ago. Dude was nuts. Also the way guys would talk about their gfs or even just love interests behind their backs was extremely depressing.

Second one was a group of nerds who had literally no sense of what romanticism was or anything so I thought I was safe. But one of them with a learning disability tried to advance on me very inappropriately. We’re still friends because I understand his learning disability and he took my kindness as flirtation. I told him that what he did wasn’t ok and set boundaries, never had a problem since.

And my third group they’re mostly just assholes. None of them have ever tried anything with me and we hang out often but sometimes they just make overly sexual/inappropriate jokes that I am not comfortable with.

"Their girlfriends thinking I liked them. 9/10 of of these girlfriends would eventually see that our friendship was actually platonic and not some sort of unrequited love situation and were cool with me, hell I became pretty close with the ones that stuck around for longer than a few months. A few women just continued to be jealous though. 

It's a shame because I ended up losing one of my best friends to an insanely jealous wife. We'd still bullshit on FB messanger here and there to catch up but it had to be in ""secre.t"" Funny thing is, once she found our messages and sat through like an hour scrolling through our convos and ended up getting MORE upset when she didn't see ANY flirting. He said she felt like she caught him in a ""gotcha"" but when it turned out to no, she was just being ridiculous it caused a huge fight.

He ended up knocking her up about 7-8 years ago so he sadly told me he'd had to delete and block me on social media since it's now about his kid on the way.

Like Tim will complain to me that Connor never texts him, and Connor will complain to me that Tim never texts him but neither of them will just send a damn text to the other.

"Unfortunately, it may have had nothing to do with you and more about how her fiancé talked about you or how he interacted with you. When I was younger, I had a boyfriend that, at some point in the relationship, it became wildly obvious he was into his female friend even though she was probably not interested and had a fiancé. I probably wasn’t very nice to her, and it didn’t really have to do with her, it had to do with how my ex-bf would talk about her to me and the way he was around her. To me there was an obvious change of behavior when she came around. I eventually dumped the boyfriend for this behavior and his behavior around another woman (who he’s started dating immediately upon breaking up) because I realized it wasn’t the women that were the problem, it was his inability to stay faithful and respectful, and this was going to be a pattern I either had to accept or move on from. I decided I didn’t want to be with a man who felt this kind of behavior was appropriate in a serious relationship.

Sadly, this woman is probably very insecure about her marriage and the behavior is likely coming from the husband. Being distant and mean to the women he’s friends with is how she handles it.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qm8cf7/women_who_primarily_had_male_friends_what_was_the/hja1rp7/,duffbeerformeee,female

"So first, even if they're not sorry, I've gotta make sure there's an understanding as to how the hurtful thing will not happen again.  Even if they're not sorry, if they're not willing to work out a plan for how we're both going to act differently that the thing isn't going to happen again, the argument isn't resolved.

And then, depending on if they can do that, or if it's feasible for me to do so, it gives me permission to emotionally write them off.  They've shown me their colors, they've told me how I can expect them to treat me in the future, that removes from me the responsibility to do any of the things I was doing to care for their feelings.  I can set boundaries around my interactions with them, and care less about how they feel about stuff.

"Therapy is obviously a good solution but if you can't get therapy I know a weird way: meditation.

I have been angry for over 6 months at an ex friend who betrayed me and 2 other friends. She isn't sorry at all and instead points fingers at me, telling everyone who wants to listen that I am a liar, saboteur and every bad name in the book. 
I used to dream about confronting her every other night and I got so sick of it! I didn't want the anger, I wanted to move on. 
Then I got a tip of this simple meditation. I had nothing to lose so I tried it and it worked instantly. 

Here's what you do: 
Imagine that you are standing before archangel Gabriel. Ask him to cut the ties you have with this person who angers you and watch as he uses a golden sword cut off strings that are attached to your body. When he's done, you need to thank him and that's it. 

I don't believe in angels nor am I religious but it worked anyway to my great surprise. The key is that you need to be willing to cut the ties. You can't do it if you're not done being angry.

"Oh, boy. I knew one like this.

Telling stories from high school that would make any grown adult cringe, but you think they make you look cool. Such as a grown man, 10 years after graduating from high school, telling you that ""yeah, so anyway, I beat that freshman up for calling me a stoner - an underclassman should *never* talk to an upperclassman like that!"". The dude was, in fact, a stoner, and who the fuck cares about freshmen vs. seniors when they are pushing 30? *Who even cared in high school?*

And to be honest, when most of their ""interesting stories"" are from that time period, more than a couple of years after they've graduated. It means that they have accomplished nothing since then.

I don't really think ""peaked in high school"" is a thing *unless* that person does nothing with their actual adult life. It's no coincidence that everyone I know who I consider to have ""peaked in high school"" turned out to be a total loser as an adult, usually entirely due to their own bad decisions. Normal people move on and make new memories, accomplish new and age-appropriate things, and have abundantly more to their personality than telling you about that time they did shrooms behind the football field in junior year.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qm7alo/what_screams_to_you_peaked_in_high_school/hj8ht7d/,vanilla__chai,female

In reality, it was just fun to enjoy youth. If people hang on to those feelings, and have 'nothing' else to brag about, I feel sorry for them, because life probably wasn't kind to them after high school.

What a fucking selfish fucking thing to do. To ask your wife if you can give her sexually to a friend for your own kink. Fucking disgusting.

She is a human not a sharing platter.

"Widower friend presured me after my childhood friend, his wife, died. I resisted for a while  and told him we should wait, it's too soon, we are both grieving.

I told him I didn't want to be a fuckbuddy and if he could swap me out for any warm body I wasn't interested. I should have been keeping my distance but I wanted to be there for him and the kids. He promised me it wasn't that, he took me on dates, he made it seem like he cared, pretended we were headed somewhere, and when he was done with me, he said ""you knew all along this was just sex"" uuuhhhh no I fucking didn't!

Even when she’s in a bad mood I don’t feel uncomfortable around her, I love just being right there with her and trying to make her smile. That’s probably my favorite thing, I know exactly how to make her smile even when she’s absolutely furious. We’ve laughed, cried, slept, and just existed together my whole life. There’s nothing that I can’t talk to her about, and it’s the same the other way around. All we want is to see the other happy and I’ve never felt a deeper and more special love than I do with her.

Both of my parents are absolutely amazing, but hopefully I’ll be able to boast about my dad some other time :) ❤️",/r/AskWomen/comments/qlwj59/for_those_women_who_havehad_a_good_relationship/hj7ofmf/,Angel_Doll28,female
"She was always supportive, not critical. She asked questions to help me think about things from a different perspective. She never commented on my body except to say I looked beautiful when I had special events or asked for it. She praised me for my intelligence, creativity, and friendliness.

My mum isn’t perfect. I had to look after both my sister and her when she was going through a divorce. She’s a bit controlling sometimes, and she extremely passionate (which can be argumentative). But I can say, especially as an adult and having lived with her during last year due to covid, she’s one of my best friends.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qlwj59/for_those_women_who_havehad_a_good_relationship/hj7s26g/,Kiwipecosa,female
"My parents are both exceptionally good people. My Mom was an awesome person before she became a Mother and she actually wanted us kids. She is such a warm, kind hearted person who loves deeply and shows it in almost everything she does. My Mom is a super introspective person and she viewed my siblings and I as actually sentient beings instead of possessions or extensions of herself. She helped guide us through life, taught us a bunch of stuff; like always doing the right thing even if it’s hard. She always showed up for us and showed support in everything we did. She’s one of my best friends and I’m truly fortunate to be her kid.

P.S. She also heavily influenced our musical tastes growing up, especially in the metal, punk and skaa genres.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qlwj59/for_those_women_who_havehad_a_good_relationship/hjabkkd/,_so_anyways_,female
"My mom was/is selfless and always put her kids first. She never preached; she taught by example.  She fulfilled all her responsibilities. Went out of her way to give me and my sister a good childhood- teaching us, reading to us, taking us on educational trips, doing crafts with us, instilling good morals and manners in us. Worked very hard at a job where she had to deal with difficult people, endured a lot of hardship in her life and in her marriage,  and I don't think I ever heard her complain. Not once. She never spoke badly about anyone.

This is false in my life. My mom suffered from schizophrenia and major depression my whole life and she was the most amazing loving angelic person I’ve ever known. She suffered in silence. There’s been a few times I’ve seen her cry and I held her. Our relationship was loving and healthy.,/r/AskWomen/comments/qlwj59/for_those_women_who_havehad_a_good_relationship/hj7bedw/,jessi-cakes,female

A month or so later, I ran into him for the first time at a friend's house since and he was acting weird.  Kind of avoiding interacting with me, but hanging around the same area.  Partway through the semi party, he said something like ""Fine, ok, we broke up!"" and then stormed out.

"My most recent ex (4 years ago). Long story short, his parents had found out we were dating and instead of breaking up with me he put distance between us, I’m assuming so he could “soul search”, I actually don’t know, and we didn’t talk much if at all for like three months. After that three months he broke up with me but didn’t really give a reason why. To this day I’m still confused why things went the way they did.

It was difficult (due to no savings, no college education, no support system), but life became easier over the years as I got a foothold. The most difficult part was doing introspection to see where I had emotional / psychological damage, and beginning to work on those issues.

It’s gonna take an arrow to the knee to get me to stop buying jeans off of shein. I’m 5’10 and there is literally no other place I can find jeans that cheap that actually go past my ankles. I’m a hardcore thrifter and it’s a gamble finding jeans that go all the way down.

"Exactly! I see a lot of people recommend thrifting as well and I think they forget that thrifting is highly dependent on where you live, unfortunately we don't all have access to stores with good items. Where I live thrift stores are either very expensive or they consist of worn out, oddly specific t-shirts (think children's baseball team logos or family reunion shirts). And then you have the issue of resellers finding thrifted items and marking them up at a large price, I've seen this with vintage sweaters, for example. And like you mentioned, thrifting or buying second hand doesn't always work out well for plus sized people either. People shouldn't be shamed for buying clothing they can afford, or find that works for them.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qm2r92/when_is_it_okay_to_buy_from_fast_fashion_websites/hj7hn2y/,OverallDisaster,female

"Yep, I agree 100% with you. I’d love to go thrifting and buy more sustainable/higher-quality clothing but I’ve had $40 leggings from stores like Torrid and Addition-Elle fall apart after one wash and I’ve had some SHEIN clothes for 3-4 years now in perfect condition.

"When that happens, I think it's usually because something about my internal conception of what ""cute"" is doesn't line up with some reality of my life.

So, like, I'll have a wardrobe full of business casual clothes that I genuinely think are cute, but my current job is a jeans and sweatshirt kind of place, or is too cold to regularly wear all the clothes I like.  So I need to dig around on pinterest to find more casual looks that are appropriate for my office setting, think of what kinds of pieces I want, and buy those.

In 7th grade, I made a blog post ranting about something and it had a lot of curse words in it because I was really upset. My best friend was reading it and her annoying ass dad was lurking behind her and saw what I had posted, and called my parents to tell on me. When I came into my room later that day, my parents had my blog post pulled up and they asked me if I wrote it. I lied out of my ass saying that I didn’t and that I got hacked and they surprisingly believed me. After that my dad started grilling all my friends about the website it was on and then he put restrictions on my computer and on our Internet in general.

Around when I first started at my job (a retail store), I jokingly tweeted the company that made our new music player that we hated it. They actually DM’d me and asked for my store number and the next day they called the store asking for suggestions to improve the music player. My boss was excited because she thought it was finally going to change but I guess it was a PR issue and my boss got lectured by *her* boss about social media use.

About 3 years into the friendship he randomly texts me and says ""Can I get a picture of your ass?"" I thought he was joking so I sent him a picture of a donkey and he said ""No you dumb bitch a picture of your butt""

It was completely fucking random, and he was the nicest person up until then, I was shocked, I thought his account was maybe hacked or something but when I got into voice chat with him he was insanely aggressive for no reason asking for pictures of my chest and kept calling me his ""little slutbag"" despite never ever doing anything even remotely sexual with him ever, I quickly removed and blocked him on everything

"Though I am not 100% done with our friendship I blocked my life long best friend on FB because honestly I am frustrated/jealous of her. I see her post about her Crossfit group and I saw her comment on 2 or 3 other people asking to hang out with them, wanting to get out the house and socialize, and it just frustrated me so I blocked her.

Sounds bad, but I hope the context makes me seem a little not as bad.

I had moved out of state and was secluded for like 5 months. Then I moved back. Ever since I got back I have been having trouble to get friends in general to hang out with me. Including my supposed best friend. I had stated on FB that I was feeling left out and hurt so my best friend DMs. When I state that I've been back for 3 months and I was the only one to initiate hanging out and we have only done so ONCE since I have been back. She started to go on about how she has been ""too stressed, busy and tired to socialize"" then I got some unsolicited advice: ""stay positive, go out, find new hobbies, join groups, meet new people."" Then she started bragging about all the people she met at Crossfit, and how complaining on FB isn't going to make things better, I shouldn't delve in the past, everyone grows up and settles down, I am not special or alone in this issue and I just need to let those people go and push forward.

I found this pretty condescending because first of all, didn't ask for advice, second of all, yes...I am aware I can meet other people. She messaged me asked what was wrong so I told her. Also, she knows my other best friend (that I have known since birth) committed suicide last year, so I am still not in the best mental state.

It was just frustrating to hear that she was ""too depressed and tired"" to hang WITH ME but I see her comment on 2 or 3 other people's statuses asking to hang out. I almost feel like she did that out of spite or something.

But yeah, I didn't want to see it. I almost felt like a jealous ex seeing my ex flirt with new people or something and just blocked her. I will hang out with her again if she apologizes but looks like she doesn't care about continuing our 17-year-long friendship and just doesn't want to say it for some reason.

"That whole ""fandom purity culture"" thing. It's not unique to any one fandom, but it *is* getting to be a real problem. It used to be that if there were elements in a story you didn't like, you didn't read it. And it was understood that it was *not* the responsibility of people on the Internet to teach you right from wrong, to coddle you, parent you, protect you, educate you, babysit you, or cater to you. It was also understood that an age gap between two characters in a relationship is not synonymous with pedophilia. (Especially if both characters in question *are* indeed adults.) Now, they'll scream the P word about *any* age gap, even if that age gap amounts to being a few hours apart. (I really wish I was exaggerating.) And it was understood that just because your story contained elements unacceptable in real life, didn't mean that you condone or endorse those elements in real life. Nowadays, all that has gone out the window...and if you criticize or question any of this, *you're* The Enemy...and probably a pervert in real life. 

Also, I find it interesting that the people who screech at fanfic writers over ""problematic"" content (and sometimes go beyond mere screeching and into death threats, rape threats, doxxing, suicide baiting, and other nastiness) aren't acting that way towards ""real"" writers who put ""problematic"" elements in their stories. They're not slipping into Stephen King's DMs to yell at him (and worse) for the child orgy in *It*. They aren't screaming at J.K. Rowling for her depiction of the goblins which could definitely be read as anti-Semitic, or her transphobic Tweets. Even though both Stephen King and J.K. Rowling have Twitter accounts, and are just as accessible as the fanfic writers who are comparative nobodies.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qloo05/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_that_happened_in_any/hj52ezj/,coffeeblossom,female

"Lol I’m in the Imagine Dragons fandom on Twitter and it has a decent mix of people of different ages. I remember in 2015, the band did an album release party in Las Vegas for their second album and there was an older girl a lot of my friends didn’t like that was going. We all had private Twitter accounts and they would talk shit in our little community. One of my friends was also going to the release party and someone had joked about punching the older girl. Someone who followed all of us started leaking the tweets and mayhem ensued. Of course because I was in the community I got roped up in it even though I didn’t necessarily talk shit (I’d make jokes to stay relevant but I don’t think I ever said anything horrible) and I looked bad because I was still “friends” with the older girl. I mean 6 years later we’re all over it but historically the fandom has had the most drama with private group chats. 

The most annoying part about it is that people in the fandom act like children and run crying to the band’s manager every time something happens, because he’s so close to fans and very responsive, and it’s so inappropriate because they contact his business email.

"http://imgur.com/a/cRcIKUZ it's not a lot, but I find this floofy lil buddy brightens my day when needed. 

The thing that helped most when I started feeling very anxious and depressed was to ask myself ""if I *wanted* to feel shit tomorrow, what would I do today to make it happen?"" And a lot of the time the answer was what I was already doing, so then I knew to stop and try to force myself to go do something else. Doesn't work all the time, sometimes you just don't have it in you, but hopefully it might be useful to you.",/r/AskWomen/comments/ql8c5k/what_is_the_biggest_health_related_issueproblem/hj1bfc9/,Qwsdxcbjking,male

"One time I had a middle aged woman ask to speak to my manager because she wanted to complain about a phrase on a shirt. She felt it was very offensive to vegans and went on this whole spiel about how she’s been a vegan for x amount of years. Super nice about it and not at all aggressive or anything.

Unfortunately, we only had the one, and after seeing her expression I agreed to take that shirt off the dummy and sell it to her. I took the dummy down and started to, well, undress it. Then without thinking I looked up and said ""Wow, I hope Chris Hansen isn't going to appear and tell me to have a seat.""

"I worked at a public heritage site for a long time. It's mainly an outdoor site and that's pretty obvious from the title (think like ""Garden"" or ""Park"" or ""Nature Reserve"" kind of deal.) It wasn't massive by any means, you could easily walk the whole thing in about a half hour if you just zoomed through.

It was also 90% flat with some steps and ramps over slight inclines. But with the exception of the paths and the features it's was grass, freshly cut every day, well-maintained, you get the idea. 

So one day it was insanely busy. The weather was nice, we had both myself and another worker on the only till that we had in the entrance, sharing it, with about 50 people crammed in the box office and a massive line up outside. We're trying to get people through as quickly as possible, it's bonkers.

These guy comes in from the site and immediately cuts in front of everyone in line. He's holding a 6-8 month old baby (I'm bad with baby ages) and he just glares at me and says, loudly in this super angry voice - ""The site wasn't at all baby friendly. We had to carry him *everywhere*.""

I didn't have time for this, so I just reached into the till, grabbed out a refund for him and his partner, put it in his hand and said ""Sorry you didn't enjoy, here's your money back."" He just stood there staring at me for a good 30 seconds, I'm guessing because he was disappointed he didn't get to yell at me more. 

It's probably not the funniest in the thread but it cracks me up every time because like....what did he expect to do with the baby? What was he expecting? Like, of course you had to carry him everywhere, he's a *baby*.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qllrr1/if_you_work_or_have_worked_in_retailcustomer/hj54mo9/,PurrPrinThom,female
"Had a guy come into a coffee shop I used to work at and ask for a ""hot iced americano"". No matter what we tried, it was always wrong. We made a regular iced americano? Nope. Hot americano on ice? No. Iced americano made with warm water? WRONG! 

We asked how he wanted it and he just said ""it's not that hard! [Other coffee shop down the street] knows how to make it!"" So I got to tell him ""well, maybe you should go there?""

"This is why I think higher education should be free. A highly educated population is a good thing even if their education isn't geared at a particular job. You're a better critical thinker. You've had more years learning about things that interest you that you never would have had time for at high school.

Even if my humanities degree hadn't helped me into my job (it did, I'm a teacher now), I still just adored learning. I read texts we never studied at school, I learnt about time periods I'd never studied, I took philosophy and religious education and film studies and theatre studies and all sorts of other interesting things that I never would have heard about had I stopped my education after high school. It means if someone references Kant, or Freud, or Nietze, or Schrodinger's cat, or Pavlov's dogs, or Brecht, or Stanislavski, or Sylvia Plath or Aristotle, or what Tony Blair was getting up to during the Iraq War, I now know what they're talking about and have an opinion on it. I can apply theories to things happening in real life. I can write more persuasively. I can work better with others.

For me, it's not all about a job. It's about learning new shit and enjoying doing so. It's a shame that this comes at such a high cost. We all agreed high school education was important enough to be free, but decided tertiary education is a luxury you should go into debt for the privilege of receiving. That debt only seems worth it if there's a job at the end of it to pay back that debt. But if there was no debt, more people might just go for the love of expanding their minds.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qktx10/what_is_a_sad_truth_but_a_hard_pill_to_swallow/hj0v6fx/,tallulahblue,female

"> I've caused him to lose his temper to where I have gotten hurt and it's my fault. 

Nobody can cause another person to hurt them. That's victim blaming. He is the only one in control of himself. I bet he doesn't punch people at work, or in public, because despite what he may want you to think, he absolutely can choose not to hurt others. He chooses not to hurt people at work because he knows there will be consequences- he will lose his job. He chooses not to punch people in public because the cops could be called. He chooses to hurt you. It is a decision he makes. No matter how angry or upset he gets, he could choose not to act on that anger like he chooses not to hurt his coworkers or people in public. And even if he's never once been annoyed by his coworkers or members of the public, and you really do push his buttons more than anyone he has ever met (doubtful!) - he could choose to break up with you if you bother him that much. Or he could walk away to cool off rather than hurting you. He could get anger management. He doesn't do any of these things because he is an abuser. 

>He's hurt me for asking to go on a date. He hasn't taken me on a date in 2 years. He forgot our anniversary and never looked back. 

You need to believe me that this isn't normal. Most relationships aren't like this. There are plenty of men out there who make an effort in their relationships and enjoy spending time with their partners and going on dates. No matter how much you love him, that's no substitute to feeling loved and cared about in return. Every second you waste with this guy you're missing out on meeting someone who will enjoy taking you on dates. Who you will love as much as your current partner but who will never hurt you. My ex didn't take me on dates and he did nothing for my birthday. After we broke up I met my now husband who plans dates all the time and makes a huge effort on my birthday. It hurt to get over the love of my ex, but now I look back and am so happy we broke up because it feels a million times better to be loved by someone who shows it in their actions. Your current partner is not going to change and become that person. 

> I really love him and I know this isn't him. I just want us to get through whatever this is. 

I agree with the other poster. This is him. This is textbook abusive behaviour. Abusers very rarely hit their partner on the first date do they? They know almost no women would stick around if they did. So they pretend to be your perfect man to get you hooked first. They love bomb you and make you believe you're the most special and wonderful person they've ever met. They keep this front up to the outside world so nobody would ever suspect them to be abusive. Then once they think they have you hooked, that's when the abusive behaviour starts. When you're deeply in love, engaged, married, or pregnant - those are the most common times for the abuse to begin. Because he knows you won't want to leave. You're attached. And you'll stick around waiting and hoping for ""the old him"" to return. If you ever seem like you've had enough and are going to leave him, he'll drop some crumbs of the ""old him"" back in to keep you hooked. The abusive behaviour will stop for a bit and he'll be charming and loving and sweet again and you'll think ""yes! This is what I've been waiting for! He's back!"" But this won't last long. He will keep it up just long enough to keep you hooked, before his true self comes out again. 

He will make you think the nasty way he treats you is not because he's abusive, but because of outside forces: his work. His mental health issues. His past traumas. His ex. Or most commonly, he'll say or imply you're to blame for his abuse. If you didn't do x, y, and z then he'd be happy. If you hadn't provoked him then he'd be happy. If you'd cleaned better then he'd be happy. If you'd catered to his every whim then he'd be happy. If you'd been more like his perfect ex he'd be happy. If you looked different he'd be happy. He does this to manipulate you into scrambling to cater to him constantly and gives him an excuse to be cruel if you ""mess up"". Notice how this manipulation benefits him and hurts you? You spend all your time trying to be the perfect girlfriend, giving him whatever he wants, and he doesn't have to put in any effort in return. He doesn't want to put any effort in in return because he doesn't actually care about making you happy. And that's not love.

He doesn't love you. He may say he does, but love is shown through actions. Consistent actions- not two years without a date. Not getting angry with you and hurting you. Not blaming you for your mistreatment. 

Accept this. He isn't going to change. Abusers never do.

There are better people out there. 

You don't deserve to be treated his way. Nobody does. 

Leaving him will be hard but one day you'll look back and thank yourself. And you'll never let anyone treat you this way again.

Imagine if you had a daughter or a best friend telling you their boyfriend was doing to them everything your boyfriend is doing to you. What would you say to them? Would you say they deserve it? Would you tell them he loves them? Would you tell them to stay? I hope not! You wouldn't want someone you love to stay in this situation.

"Cooking - try to find easy meals. I typically don’t eat breakfast on the weekdays, but I have some premade breakfast sandwiches I can pop in the microwave. For lunch, I buy a few lean cuisines or I eat leftovers. I cook dinner 3-4 times a week and I do easy meals like baked chicken, or crockpot meals. For crockpot days, I put the food in in the morning or latest by 12pm. When I do cook dinner i make extra for leftovers. I do tend to make a big breakfast on the weekends for my husband and I and then we usually eat out or my husband will do dinner on the weekends. I do grocery pickup at Walmart or target because I hate going into the grocery store these days 

Cleaning - I clean as I go. I do dishes every night or morning, or load the dishwasher at night if the day was particularly busy. I wipe down all the counter tops in the kitchen every night, put dishes away. Once a month when the fridge is basically empty from me being too lazy to go grocery shopping, I take advantage to wipe down the inside of the fridge and freezer. For the bathroom, I really just keep everything neat so it doesn’t get very messy…once I week I wipe down the sink with Clorox wipes, clean the toilet, spray down the shower with Clorox spray. Every 2 weeks I vacuum and clean the vinyl flooring in the kitchen. We have a 2 bath apartment, my husband is responsible for cleaning his bathroom, I don’t touch it 

Laundry - my husband does his own laundry. I do the sheets every 2 weeks (I change out my sheets every week but have laundry dividers to organize the dirty laundry) when I have a couple of sets to fill the washer. I do my laundry once a week, and I do the whites every two weeks and towels once a week or every week and a half. Honestly, I make sure we have enough linens and towels to last us a while for when things are busy and I don’t have time to do laundry weekly 😂 

Seeing friends - my husband and I are pretty introverted and don’t need a ton of social interaction but we see my family at least once a month (his family lives out of state) and we get together with friends for dinner or drinks every 2-3 months…lol we are involved with our church so we are a part of the services a couple times a week so that’s enough for us 

Personal time - I mentioned husband and I are introverted so we try to give each other time. I am fortunate to work from home, and I start work early so I can end early and have alone time before he gets home from work around 5:30. We eat dinner together and sometimes he will go play video games or read outside while I watch tv or sometimes I let him have the tv and go do my beauty routine or go read a book in bed or something. On the weekends, sometimes we chill at home and play video games together, or sometimes go out and do an activity together then when we get home we go our separate ways 😂 we try to give each other time but we are mostly okay spending a lot of time together and end up doing diff things in the same room (like I’m reading on the couch while he watches YouTube or whatever). 

Beauty routine - I just do it after my shower. It doesn’t take too long, I have a few serums I use and a mask once a week haha. 

Workout - yeah this is kind of the thing I’m not great at. I try to get it in but once everything else is done I kind of want to veg out for the evening. I do have a dog I walk about 5 times a day, then a extra long walk at nights so I do get my steps in and some activity.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qldwz7/how_do_you_find_time_for_everything_how_to/hj2t87d/,cumberbatchpls,female

He started to crawl towards the stairs so instead of picking him up I just human barricaded in front the stairs (this worked, he didn't fall down them) my brain just farted, I was kind of afraid of picking him up, also just didn't want to get touched by those spit hands again.

"I have a very low opinion of recreational illicit drug use. I think it’s a shallow, privileged, entitled thing to do and just hate what it represents. I don’t respect it at all. 

It’s an empty way to have a good time. It’s such a symbol of reckless privilege to me, since I mostly see it done by wealthy, yuppie people in positions where they know they don’t have to fear being shaken down by police. It fuels cartel and gang violence and its users get to be willfully ignorant of the human consequences of their high. They’re ok with playing Russian roulette with addiction, a condition that would make them hurt everything and everyone around them, which is so thoughtless and entitled to me. 

The people who do get addicted are dangerous to themselves and others in a way that causes real harm. It damages brains and leads to crime and homelessness. Once addicted, rehabilitation success rates are also miserably low, even with the highest standards of care. 

I arrived at my views by watching a loved one succumb to addiction after recreational use and seeing how heart wrenching and also futile the situation is now. I live in a city with many drug addicted homeless and the drug addiction part is like the elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about.

I don’t view it as a moral failing to have self-medicated in lieu of being deprived of mental healthcare, but to willingly use for fun is gross to me, and I also don’t think anything good would come of legalization of highly addictive, brain damaging substances. Alcohol is already bad enough and I don’t have a good opinion of heavy drinking either.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qlbnah/what_is_your_position_on_drugs/hj1vlqa/,Confetticandi,female

"In terms of “recreational” drugs…it’s tricky. Personally I’ve never taken anything “stringer” than weed. I find the hard core drugs scary - but that might just be societal conditioning. I don’t think people who take hard core recreational drugs should necessarily be criminally prosecuted, but I also don’t think taking the drugs should be decriminalised. I’m well aware how contradictory that is, but essentially I don’t think we should necessarily punish addicts (I mean I was a dumb teenager who got addicted to cigarettes by being a dumb teenager) but we shouldn’t be making it easier for people to fall into recreational drug addiction.

In terms of prescription drugs. Again it’s difficult. I would never ask my doctor to prescribe me anything, but prescription drugs make me a little nervous. I don’t know anything about prescription drugs. If a doctor prescribes me something, I’ll take it, but make sure I literally only take it exactly as prescribed. I do wonder sometimes about whether more consideration should be given over what drugs are prescribed to people - limiting highly addictive prescriptive drugs - but I also feel like that isn’t something I really have the knowledge about to really comment on.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qlbnah/what_is_your_position_on_drugs/hj1v3ul/,DisloyalMouse,female

After some life experience, I feel like that's a little over simplified and shit doesn't exist in a vacuum. I have changed my mind on benzos, opiates and meth. I think those should be decriminalized. Dealing should be a misdemeanor and possession should involve confiscation and documentation followed by a referral to a recovery program. I'd like to say just legalize those but I am sorry, weed/LSD/and even coke just don't really destroy lives like opiates/meth do and benzos you can die from W/D.

"I work in the medical field, sometimes in emergency, and my entire family is dead from addiction. I have one living family member. I am not an MD.

I will tell you that amphetamine psychosis is different for everyone. I can also confidently say that a great majority of addicts are pretty motivated to acquire money, and that MOST homeless people aren't addicted to methamphetamine in my area, although I acknowledge it is regional. However, most common culprit across all regions, is alcohol. Do you think alcohol should be a controlled substance?

I have never seen anyone addicted to PCP so cannot comment on it.

Methamphetamine is given to children as young as 6 in the form of a drug named Desoxyn. There's plenty of information about it, even regarding the abuse of it. Adderall is widely prescribed, and is mixed amphetamine salts. I think you're being naive about what ""illegal"" means. Drugs are not illegal, they are controlled substances. They're illegal for manufacture and illicit sale, there's nothing illegal about being a drug addict.

"My recommendation: pick up 1-2 pairs of weights and do bodyweight/strength training at home. It only takes the space of a yoga mat and used weights can be found for cheap. If you can't afford them, there's loads of bodyweight workouts for all skill and strength levels. You can do lunges in between two chairs so you can use your arms to help push you up. Wall push-ups. Sit-ups with a pillow behind you to make them easier. Shallow triceps dips off of a stool. Planking from your knees. 

I do 10-20min of strength and a somewhat vigorous 15-30min walk five times a week. I just pop in my headphones, toss on a podcast, and stroll around the neighborhood. 

It might not be the best, but it's better than nothing. I'm kinda depressed and doing lots of work is hard for me, so this is a compromise I've made with myself and it's pretty fun!",/r/AskWomen/comments/qknbn6/what_is_something_you_doubted_until_you_tried_it/hiy9sfr/,Anrikay,female

"If you’re looking for sneaker type shoes, go to a store like Fleet Feet where they will scan your foot (it’s free) and find shoes that will fit your foot shape. I did that and they put me in some fancy new balances and they are by FAR the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever own. Pricey, though.

Edit; also, the nice thing too is that with the foot scan you can know what to look for in other kinds of shoes. For example, I always thought I had a wide foot but turns out my toe box area is wide (pinky toe to ball of foot) which has helped me talk to sales people of other kinds of shoes about what might fit me.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qknbn6/what_is_something_you_doubted_until_you_tried_it/hiywwks/,DoinTheBullDance,female

Funny thing is, the hand will acclimate quicker than the test of the body. So when it feels like a decent cool temp, I get in and get under the water in sections. First my hands, then my arms, then either my chest or my hair (usually hair first but not scalp) then I'll do back then scalp. The trick is to take big deep breaths the whole time. I mean it.

"That’s only a case study, so it just proves that this association has happened once, and doesn’t prove causality..

I found this [Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31324419/) of all of the studies done on cup safety (up to 2019), it shows that there are definite potential risks of their use, but not that endometriosis is one of those risks",/r/AskWomen/comments/qknbn6/what_is_something_you_doubted_until_you_tried_it/hiyz2rt/,megsweg,female

"I think that in order to get rid of a self-destructive habit, you need:

* To be able to identify the habit when it's happening
* To understand why you're doing it
* To be committed to not doing it for your own sake
* To find a different way to meet the need you're filling with the self-destructive happen
* To create a plan to make sure you'll always be able to avoid the self-destructive habit.
* To forgive yourself if you slip up, and get right back to the plan.

Those things might not all be there the moment you realize you've got a self-destructive habit.  But you're going to need them all eventually if you want it to stick.

"That all depends. With enough money, you can afford medical/surgical enhancements, a personal trainer, a personal chef, makeup artists, a personal dietitian and nutritionist, a personal skin care expert, a person who does your hair, a person who chooses your clothes, etc. For people at a celebrity level of wealth, like actors, all of those kinds of things come into play and make a huge difference in comparison to what those people would look like If they were not paying for those services.

However, there is the base package of what we each start with. Some people start with great genetics, body build, height, facial structure, great skin, etc. If you're starting from there, it will be a lot different than if you were starting from average everything. 

So some aspects of beauty can be bought depending on the amount of money that you have and others can't be bought but are part of your genetic inheritance.

"I've been training in a Korean karate style called Tang Soo Do for over 9 years. My take on one-time self defense classes, especially ones geared toward women, is that they are mostly a waste of time. It's not that they have bad information (although some certainly do), but you simply can't learn to respond to a high-stress situation in a single class. You need to train regularly to build muscle memory.

I also taught martial arts classes, but that takes a long time to even get a basic skill level competency.  And people do not understand how much of an advantage size and weight and strength can give a person, and that will cause frustration in women time and time again.  It sucks.

Judo and BJJ are both good styles. Ultimately it will come down to what is available in your area, what school has a class schedule you can actually attend, the cost that you can afford, and having good instructors.

"That they would pay off my college loans when I graduated. 

They talked me into going out of state at the age of 18 (kids are so dumb at 18!) and then they practically went bankrupt two years later. 

My grandfather agreed to co-sign on my private loans... in exchange for me signing away the rights to our family's log cabin and land. He then dumped millions into a failed camp on said land. 

My dad used all of his retirement money to open a new law firm (that tanked). Then he got his PhD, he pretty much stopped working, and his daddy paid for all of it. 

So now I have six figure private student loans that I will probably never be able to pay off.

My credit is totally ruined, as is my brother's because they took out a credit card in his name. I feel like I signed my whole life away at 18, including my rights to a place that is so dear to my heart. 

It was especially hard because my grandfather is rich and paid for my dad's college, law degree, Masters degree, and his PhD.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qkmfel/what_lie_did_your_parents_tell_you_consistently/hizjpvn/,anyesuki,female

"My best friend moving away without telling me when I was 13. We’d been friends since I was six, but in the last year I’d pulled back thinking I’d see how long it took her to contact me. As you can imagine she didn’t, but we still saw each other once school started and would hang out waiting for the bus and then while riding.

Then one day she didn’t show up, or the next, or the next, and after a week I mentioned to my mom that she must be really sick. My mom told me she’d moved. Apparently everyone but me knew. She didn’t tell me, didn’t say goodbye or anything. I felt so incredibly hurt and unimportant.

I responded by bailing on my entire friend group at school (which she wasn’t a part of) because I didn’t really like how they treated me. For the first three years of high school I didn’t reach out or make plans with anyone. I just kept to myself and talked to a small friend group at school. I eventually started reaching out again, but I’ve never been as open as I was before that or really gotten past the feelings that someone I cared about so much could think so little of me.

"I was in a movie theater when a gun shooting broke out. This was years before the Aurora movie shooting. It was my first winter break from college and I was in my hometown. I went to the movie theater and a gunfight broke out. We learned later that no one got shot, but it was surreal running out the exits and through the parking lot, not knowing what was happening, but knowing we had to run, run, run away. (It is surreal to read the news the next day. It’s clinical and matter of fact, which contrasts highly with the fear and emotions of living through it. When I see headlines, I always wonder how horrible and frightening it must be for the people who lived those headlines.) 

I’m an anxious person and that experience made me more daring. If I could die doing such an innocuous thing as watching a movie in a movie theater in my small hometown, then the big world became less threatening. While I do take reasonable precautions, I try to not let my fear of the unknown hold me back. I can still be an anxious and scared person sometimes, but that brush with random violence really shifted my perspective. I travel solo in other countries as a woman. I sign up for random classes. I do things because I’m interested in them, even if I will be bad at them. I say yes to things because I don’t know when or how I will die. 

It was not my first or last brush with random violence, but it was a foundation upon which I built myself: I could die watching a movie so I may as well try scary things that I’m interested in.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qkb9ie/what_single_event_has_had_the_biggest_impact_on/hix9uz6/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

Fully came out to myself as transgender that night and decided that I wanted to transition.

"I asked for one recently saying I was unhappy with my pay given the extra responsibilities I've taken on this year (with examples), pointed out that it would be expensive to replace me and that if I didn't get a raise I'd start looking for another job.

"Once it didn't go well at all. I was accused of being a money-grubber. They were asking me to move from a super low cost of living area to Seattle and they didn't want to give me more than a couple percent raise. Rent is literally triple and I am being greedy for expecting local cost of living to be factored in? Lol, no. 

Another time it went as expected. After a review, they gave me the raise I requested and gave me clear direction on what I needed to do to hit my next promotion/raise milestone.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qksf67/how_did_you_ask_for_a_raise_at_work_what_happened/hiyg1mf/,VanthGuide,female

"They're fun. When I'm socializing with people outside of cons, I feel like there's a lot of pressure to come across as normal, but when I'm surrounded by the other types of people who go to the nerdy sorts of conventions that I go to, I feel like it's not such a big deal if I'm awkward or weird.

"I don't believe it's possible to suddenly ""fall in love"" with some brand new person in a meaningful enough way for that relationship to deserve to outweigh our years of marriage. It would be limerance with a new person who's largely unknown and about whom all the unknowns are filled in with fantasy and imagination, versus an actually known spouse who is perceived in full actuality without all the interwoven fantasy and imagination.

Therefore, if my spouse thought he fell in love with someone else, I would want him to realize that it wasn't important enough to outweigh his loyalty to me. I would want him to tell me about his feelings so we could discuss the situation and use it to strengthen our relationship. It sounds like it would be important for us to try to get on the same page about this person, so I would want to know what my spouse liked so much about them, so I could either learn to see this person the same way and feel similarly about them (in which case we might be headed for either developing a new mutual best friend or mutually dating this person) or else present my spouse with some reasons not to trust or like this person so much.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qk0r3i/if_your_partner_fell_in_love_with_someone_else/hiuy8pw/,queerbychoice,female

"I agree.

There’s also the type of love you share with friends that you trust. Crushes also happen and it’s totally normal. If my SO wants to tell me about his crushes, (which he has) I’ll tease him about it. It’s adorable. He’s a person, not an object. I can’t control who he might find attractive. It would be ridiculous to try. 

However, to put yourself in a situation where you actively *fall in love* with someone—Takes quite a bit of effort and a whole lot of denial. It should also be considered if you are actually *in love* with this person, or are you looking for greener grass as a means to escape? Have you gone past the physical stage and find yourself bored or neglecting the relationship? 

If you make a habit of ending one relationship because you’ve found the “love of your life”—it means you didn’t love any of those people to begin with. You were looking to escape into another whirlwind honeymoon phase.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qk0r3i/if_your_partner_fell_in_love_with_someone_else/hivy1cr/,wonkywilla,female

"It's not a daily thing for me. Well, it depends on your definition of junk food I guess? To me, junk food is generally the sorta stuff you could get from a fast food chain. Maybe some extra super fatty, oily meals too. Greasy takeaways and the versions you can get from supermarkets - ready meals, freezer food etc.

I have one meal like this a week, usually a Friday or Saturday. It's the one day me and my SO can say ""fuck it"" and not cook or do dishes. It's a treat! It also makes it easier for me to watch what I eat through the week knowing I get to indulge soon. 

Things lik crisps, sweets? I'll probably have something like this in one form or another most days. A couple of biscuits with a cuppa, that sort of thing. I'm *much* better and more disciplined than I used to be with this.

Tbh it didn’t do anything. I think due to me not really having strong ties to social media in general it played a role in why I fr feel nothing now that it’s gone,/r/AskWomen/comments/qjvs5x/women_who_deleted_their_social_media_account_how/hitawxx/,AvocadoBitter7385,female
"I deleted FB about a year & a half ago. I don't miss all the drama and douchey guys who use it as a dating site, I think the whole facebook ""empire"" is evil and has done real harm to the world too, but my social circle got MUCH smaller afterward. All the shitty people disappeared, but so did a lot of people I actually liked. I'm an introvert but I feel very isolated now. Perhaps if I'd deleted it 5 years ago instead of in the middle of a series of quarantines it might have gone differently, but I dunno. in 2014 I deactivated it for a couple months, and when I reactivated I had 13 messages asking if I was okay, was I still alive, etc. No one texted or called and it kind of opened my eyes to the sad reality that social media is our main form of communication now. People either think you died or they just forget you exist if you stop showing up in their feed. We can text & call of course but a lot of people simply can't be bothered to go out of their way to include the *one* person who's not on the app everyone else is on. I can text them first and they'll respond, but those conversations usually peter out pretty quickly with them saying ""you should get back on facebook, texting sucks"". 

I wish we could go back to the old ways but I doubt it'll ever happen. This is just how things are now. I've been tempted to make a new account with fake info so fuckerberg can't profit off my data, just to get back some semblance of connection as pathetic as it might be. My son is too young to be vaccinated and I live with my elderly aunt & mom too, I can't risk bringing anything home to my family so it's not like I can just go join some hobby groups or go out to dinner with friends. I work from home too so all my communication even with coworkers is online. I'm in this conundrum of stick to my guns and keep being left out, or go back to using a platform I hate.

"Individually? Wearing/using clothes as long as possible is probably the most sustainable thing you can do regardless of where you buy it. My father still has sweaters from the 80s that are still worn today. 

After that would be extending the life length of clothes by buying second hand clothes. This is also cheaper in a lot of cases. 

Then i’d consider brands that are more sustainable. These are often more expensive, so they’re only actually an option for rich people. Moreover, you have to take your time to research whether a brand is actually good enough for its workers and the environment. 

But to be honest, some people should also buy less clothes in general. You don’t need a clothing haul every month or two, whether that’s from SHEIN or the most ethical and sustainable brand in existence.

"I don’t have kids, but I expect people to be respectful, and understand that it is a normal thing that should not bother anyone. 

A few years ago my sister, her two kids and I were flying to Canada from Germany. My niece was a few months old at the time, still being breastfed. So, we’re sitting there, whilst the plane was still being boarded, and my sister pulls out a shawl to cover herself and the baby so she could breastfeed. Believe me, you could not see anything. But then this flight attendant comes over and tells my sister she couldn’t do that at her seat because it could make other passengers uncomfortable, but she was welcome to use one of the toilets. I very nearly made a scene, but my sister just told the guy she wasn’t going anywhere, other than to speak to his superior. She finished, gave me the baby to burp her, and she went to speak with the head flight attendant. The guy was moved to a different section of the plane and we didn’t see him again. The head steward, an older lady, was extremely apologetic and deferential, which was nice, but my sister never received an apology or acknowledgement from the airline, despite sending them a strongly worded email. She has never flown with that airline since then.",/r/AskWomen/comments/ql0fkh/what_do_you_expect_for_the_society_people_while/hizvid4/,xvmeadar,female

"He truly and deeply loved me, I was emotionally unavailable and not even working on it AND I knew it but still “tried” dating him and in a way gave him hope.

I was young and didn’t really realize how idiotic it was to be crushing on this guy that had no future plans while someone that loved me had a whole life and career spanning out. Alas, I flirted with the idea and he did give me the space since he was leaving for a month, the crush died out and when he came back, we “tried” again. This time I truly was trying but it’s a lot to work through and I guess I didn’t show it enough that he just gave up on me and ghosted me. I hated him for a while until I realized he did it to prioritize his happiness and now I just regret how much of an asshole I was and regret that I didn’t try harder at first and ended up hurting him.

As I replied to someone else in this thread, due to the exact circumstances surrounding what happened to me, I'm certain that he'd have gotten off with it.  There's not a court in the land that would have convicted him. Even if I *had* reported him, it's incredibly unlikely that he would have faced any lasting consequences, and I'd have been left with my sex life aired in public.  I would have had my morals and ethics questioned (and possibly branded ""a slut"", because that's what happens to so many women during such trials).

"i wish that someone would’ve told me about how to cope healthily, and about how her feelings towards me aren’t indicative of how i am as a person.


it affected me in different ways as i grew up. i first realized that she was negligent and unloving when i was about 13, which was around the time my mental health issues were gradually getting worse. i was self-harming and often suicidal, and she punished me for it. i remember writing in my diary that i wanted to die because of her, and she read my diary and punished me for saying that i wanted to die.


from about that age up until i was 16/17, we fought a lot and i could tell she had a LOT of disdain for me. she talked badly about me to her friends, punished me for various symptoms of mental illness; i’ve been severely depressed since early teenage years and also have generalized anxiety disorder as well as adhd, which was undiagnosed at the time. my room was messy, my grades often slipped, i kept to myself in my room most of the time, etc. and i was punished/yelled at constantly for it all.


i think the worst part is that looking back, all the symptoms of all my mental health issues were extremely prevalent, and she didn’t think twice about any of it. she’s a medical professional; a registered nurse and nursing educator at a university in my state, yet didn’t even consider that i might be mentally ill. just so much neglect on her part.


i still live at home now but am pretty self-sufficient, and am medicated for my depression and adhd which makes her much easier to deal with.


another big thing that affected me was that my dad and i were the only two people she treated like this. i have two younger brothers, and she tends to favor them most of the time. it’s so painfully obvious. my dad just puts up with her behavior and, despite that he knows it’s wrong, doesn’t ever stand up for me or for himself. i can understand why; divorces are expensive, the fights don’t ever yield any change in her so there’s no use pushing back, etc. but i wish he would stop telling me that she acts like this “because she loves us” or “because she means well.” it’s BS.


i struggled with self esteem issues really badly when i realized that my mom doesn’t love me. i wish someone was there to tell me that there’s nothing wrong with me just because she treats me this way. i’ve learned now to know that i deserve better and not to accept shit from her anymore, and i don’t. truthfully, i think my resistance to her cruelty intimidates her. i still struggle with lots of horrible mental health issues and it feels awful to not be able to go to my mom when i feel like all i want in the world is a loving mother figure, but i make do with the people i *do* have supporting me in my life even if my mom isn’t one of them.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qk0u2v/those_of_you_who_grew_up_with_an_unloving_mother/hiuo7w1/,d4h-lia,female
"The most important thing about an unloving parent: nothing you can do will make them love you, so as hard as it is, stop hustling for their approval and love. Practise loving yourself. That’s what you will have to do as an adult, anyway. In every situation, ask yourself what you would want a loving parent to do for you now, and then do it for yourself. Show yourself that love, comfort yourself, do good things for yourself to make you happy, encourage yourself when things aren’t going great. 

That last one is big: even with loving but overly critical parents, people tend to have a voice in their head that keeps saying: you can’t do it. You’re not good enough. You’re stupid.

Recognize that voice, accept that it’s lying and replace it by actively telling yourself (every time the voice wants to say something negative): I am good enough. I am able to do this, I just need more practice. I have a good head on my shoulders and can figure this out.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qk0u2v/those_of_you_who_grew_up_with_an_unloving_mother/hiv4d8b/,Jollydancer,female

"I am an only child. My mother wanted more than one child but she had a lot of problems conceiving. She had a lot of miscarriages and I was the only child that survived all of her attempts to conceive. You could think that me being an almost miracle child, I would be spoiled but the thing is, my parents wanted a boy and, too bad, I'm a girl.

When I was little, I was treated ""normally"", as much as I can remember, because, before puberty, your gender doesn't show much, so I was treated like a boy (good thing I never had an interest in girly things, I loved playing football with my dad, I had ""male"" interests) and my parents loved me. Then, puberty hits, and I started to look more and more like a girl. That's when (I felt like) they stopped loving me and caring for me. We moved out from a town I loved, I knew by heart and some friends and moved to a town where the only thing was cornfields and one tobacco shop. The town was inhabited mostly by old people and it was as boring as you can imagine. I started to become more and more isolated. I'm a very introverted person and it takes time to have my trust.

As I grew up, my mom started to hate me. She would yell at me for no reason, she punished me for no reason, if something was wrong, it was my fault. I was her emotional punching bag. The few things I told her about my personal life, she would find a way to turn it against me so I ended up not talking to her. I hated my life at home. A simple ""Hello"" or ""Good morning"" would end up in her yelling at me. In high school, I left 30min early in the morning to wait for the bus because I would rather spend 30min in the cold at 6 am in the winter than to be with her. And at the end of the day, I walked veeeeery slowly because I did not want to go back home. I used to cry during the traject between the bus and my house. 

Now I live away from her, I try no contact, blocking her from everywhere. At my old apartment, she sent me the cops once because I blocked her and didn't want to talk to her or anyone from my family. She did a lot of other things (yay r/raisedbynarcissists) but I try to not think about it. Now, I considere that I don't have a family.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qk0u2v/those_of_you_who_grew_up_with_an_unloving_mother/hiwc3hb/,alienonymous2,female

"This is a copy from a comment I did a year or two ago, so ignore any seemingly unusual context.  And feel free to ask me any questions. 

I watch and manage high voltage power transmission lines for renewable energy sources in West Texas.

I got this job by being in the Navy for a number of years as a power plant operator, then becoming a nuclear plant operator, then going to college and dropping out, then getting really lucky.

EDIT: Anyone seeking more info about getting a transmission job can ask me questions, but I did a reply to a vet below that I will copy here.

[Take a read through this. Transmission Operator(or TO) is the certificate I would recommend trying to get as a base level.](http://www.nerc.com/pa/Train/SysOpCert/Pages/default.aspx) From there, you can move up to a Reliability Operator.

That page also has some detailed resources on it, but it can be a bit intensive.

Another primer you can look into is [Power for Vets](http://www.incsys.com/power4vets/). They offer a set of courses to help military vets gain access to the power generation and transmission industries. I think you have to pay them some money, but it is not a huge amount. It used to be free, though. And I have heard you can get some assistance with the payment, but reports vary.

Overall, the test for getting certified(regardless of level) is roughly 600 dollars per try. After that, you have a really good bargaining chip with companies by saying you are motivated enough to have gone out and get your cert on your own. We have hired two Power for Vets trainees, so I know it can help you on your resume.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qjc49a/women_that_make_over_100k_a_year_that_didnt_go_to/hiqb8ok/,Sand_Dargon,female

"I began feeling much more like Mom than a wife (or anything else). My entire life revolved around keeping the house clean and doing my best to not only keep the kid alive, but keep him entertained and healthy and learning.

Husband thought that cooking (and leaving dirty dishes behind) was enough housework. He thought that playing with the baby and changing a few diapers was enough. I did the lion's share of the housework and baby care.

That built HUGE resentment.

The last thing I want to do with someone who I resent is to have sex with them. I didn't lose interest in sex, I lost interest in doing one doing one more goddamn thing for that man after I'd spent all day cleaning up his messes and raising his kid and washing the dishes and *I went to bed so I could sleep...*

Lol I know intense but lemme explain… 

When I was in love many years ago, our love felt like a real tangible physical thing, like I could snap my fingers and our love would magically appear in front of us as an object. It consumed my thoughts and my whole being. I just wanted to be near them and be with them all the time.

This was the first time I was ever in love with someone but it was so overwhelming and **profound** and all-consuming, like I was… *being devoured*. By love itself.

"for me i think it depends. being in love when it’s brand new and just beginning feels **“effervescent.”** bubbly and shimmery and exciting, butterflies in your stomach all the time.


with where i’m at with my boyfriend right now (about 6 months), it feels **“snug”**; warm, cozy, still exploring each other but comfortable and secure at the same time. i’d also maybe describe it as **“sultry”**; warm, but in a more passionate way. intimacy, longing, craving, becoming closer by the minute…lots of emotions. it often feels as if we’re the only two people in the whole world.

"My ex husband has severe ADHD that was only diagnosed when he was already in his 30s. The more life responsibilities we had, the less functional he became, and it left me with stress-induced anxiety that I had to medicate for for several years. I was holding on for him to start treatment, but it ended up not being very helpful, since where we live adults can't get prescribed the vast majority of ADHD meds due to being controlled substances, and he has no access to therapy. 

Two years later and it was definitely the right choice. We're still good friends, but he lives in an absolute mess, he can barely feed himself, and is constantly worried about losing his job. I help when I can but mostly stay away for my own mental wellbeing. I'm left very bitter about our healthcare system and with a bunch of trust issues, but I'm in a more functional relationship now.

"I had a friend of a friend that I ghosted because he was being super creepy, kept trying to get pictures of me just wearing a bra, told him if he asked again I would block him on everything

He did so I blocked him for about 3 months, eventually he talked to me in person and said he was sorry and wanted to be friends and he promised not to push for pictures or anything

Later found out he said something along the lines of ""Trying to get this bitch to give me pictures but she won't"" To one of my friends and he went right back to being blocked lol",/r/AskWomen/comments/qiyelz/have_you_unghosted_someone_before_gave_someone_a/hin3qlv/,MidnightFireHuntress,female
"I recently unghosted a guy that lives in my building. We used to drink and smoke cigarettes, here and there. Ghosted him because he tried to make a move, disregarding my relationship. It was dumb, but I asked if he wanted to join me for a smoke the other night, after I had some wine (it’s been 2-3 months since we had talked). All was well, but just two nights ago, a mutual friend asked if I wanted to grab a drink up the street. I agreed and guess who was there? My neighbor. It was fine. I had one drink and danced a bit with our mutual friend. Trust me, I’m not even a good dancer/ I have no moves/ it was dorky. Finally, we all walked back to my building together. When the neighbor and I were in the elevator, he cornered me and he started growling at me, calling me a whore and him the devil. He said that I was messing with his emotions and that he would ruin my life. I started shaking and crying, and finally was able to run to my apartment. The next day, I told him to never speak to me or my partner again. I’m praying he leaves me alone.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qiyelz/have_you_unghosted_someone_before_gave_someone_a/hip079h/,spaceistheplacetobe,female
"I ghosted a deeply loved friend because it was too painful to be friends with them because I had such strong more-than-friends feelings for them.

Me just leaving like that with no explanation haunted me and I genuinely felt like such a POS for literally years. So I put my big girl pants on and messaged them years later apologizing.

In my message, I was sure to emphasize they didn’t need to respond or accept my apology or feel pressured to be friends with me, that what I was writing was a sincere apology and that was it. I just wanted them to know I was deeply sorry.

I never said the extent of my sorrow or how leaving them affected me because I thought that would be laughably inappropriate to share with now a stranger lol

To my shock, they responded.

We started talking again for a few months, catching up and even talking about why I left and how we both felt about it.

I never shared exactly why I left which was probably confusing for them but I genuinely thought I was going to be made fun of so that is why I didn’t.

Talking to them felt really strange because all those feelings I once had for this person were gone and it was like I was talking to and seeing them for the first time. I guess in a way I was.

I tried my best to keep it casual and not weighty like a commitment to friendship or something because it was all super new and I wasn’t sure if they wanted to even be my friend. We were just being friendly, ya know?

A couple months go by and just like before when I was first friends with them the responses to my messages are super short and to the point and I’m not getting the impression they want to be friends which is ok and expected.

Right before I stop talking with them again, I write out a lengthy reply detailing worries they had about something. I was trying to be assuring and I shared some personal info with them and all they said was, “thanks”.

I was crushed and confused because I felt like this wasn’t a “normal” response to what I said. It just reminded me so much of what it was like before. I would share and get personal with them and they didn’t appear to care or consider my feelings.

I felt really unheard and used and even betrayed and so I stopped talking to them again which I regret because instead of communicating how I felt, I just left. Again. Like an ass.

I’ve thought about them some since, even having dreams about the friendship we shared but eh, there’s other fish in the sea. I’m sure I’m not missed lol

I did look back some time later to see if they had messaged me again and no, they hadn’t, so perhaps this was mutual disinterest which is completely fine and ok.

So to answer your question - no, I don’t regret my apology and recognizing what I did was wrong and messaging them but I do regret leaving them again without a word.

But this time, I am going to let it be because I honestly don’t think our attempt at rekindling our friendship meant much. And that’s ok.

Side note: this is just my perspective of what happened. They probs have a different story.

My sophomore year we were making valentines in Spanish class (either for friends, family, or boy/girlfriends).  And I, in all my high school-aged brilliance, made a card for this boy telling him I thought he was cool and that I wanted us to be friends (all in badly written Spanish).  The teacher said she would be delivering the cards we made at lunch and it was around that time I began to realize what I'd done.  That teacher must have read my card and decided to save my bacon because a classmate who had Spanish after our lunch period said she saw my card still lying in the classroom behind the teacher's desk--undelivered.  I'm not sure if she was right, but I like to think it was never given to him because I still shudder thinking about it.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qjdks3/what_are_your_awkward_flirting_stories_from_when/hiq579c/,saturnsun_3,female

I don't think you can judge a girl for lacking the wisdom and experience to know lots of other women don't subscribe to narrow societal boxes for stereotypical femininity.   There is so much mass marketing directed at young girls they can't know yet.  If a girl has been told *by adults* her whole life she ""isn't like other girls"" you can't expect that minor child to know better.

It's going to take most women until their mid-twenties at least to realize how many other women are exactly like them.

"I’m very picky about who I spend my time and energy on and I don’t like forced interactions. I love the type of friendships where I immediately “click” with the other person, but that doesn’t happen too often. Although I’m introverted, I’m very outgoing with those who I click with. The few friends I have are very special to me because we just have this special shared energy which remains no matter how long we go without hanging out or talking to each other. They love and appreciate all my quirks and I’m most myself around them. 

I guess that’s why I find it difficult to make new friends. I know very quickly whether I have the potential to be close friends with someone and if I’m not feeling it, I won’t force it. With my two closest friends, I knew very soon after meeting them that they were right for me and we naturally gravitated towards each other. 

Also, it’s been a while since I’ve been in any situations where I’ve been able to make friends organically. Bumble BFF is tricky because even though I may have come across people that I have the potential to become friends with, it’s difficult to get past the messaging barrier and get to know each other. 

I’m hoping to go to some meetup events sometime but the other issue is that I interact better with people 1 on 1. Group events have always been weird for me and I have a tendency to just end up finding one person I get on with and talking to them individually instead.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qive89/why_do_you_find_it_hard_to_make_friends/himoql6/,glowmilk,female
"Because I’m an adult in my mid 20s, everyone’s always busy and when you finally meet up with friends all you do is make plans to see eachother again. Plans that’ll likely be canceled because everyone’s always so busy. I’m guilty of it too! it seems to be the default once you’re out of college and everyone’s working on a career or has a family.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qive89/why_do_you_find_it_hard_to_make_friends/himrpva/,StupidBirdHato,female

My friends who are trapped in a marriage they aren't happy in, they'd rather sit and complain and cry and whine instead of trying to fix things or get a divorce, I'm sick of hearing it, so I'll just ignore it or bring up something else

"I'm reading a lot of this to get advice myself, as I soon move into a new kind of job (a desk job). I have previously only worked retail (grocery stocking), but with my chronic illness I am no longer able. There is one thing I picked up from that job, though:

Do not work *too* hard. It may make you feel accomplished and good at first. It may make you think you're going to be respected better and have job security. That may be true, but beyond that you're going to be the go-to person to do the work. The hard work that you strain yourself to do will no longer be seen as you going above and beyond, but instead as the base expectation of how you will work every day. In addition, more work will be stacked on top of that eventually, and you will be expected to do it.

Our society loves to tell us that hard work equals reward. But this isn't true, all hard work gets you is more work.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qidij5/what_would_you_tell_young_women_who_are_just/hij7lp0/,WoodwindsRock,female

you don't have to run team building/social stuff if you don't want to.

If your boss is being gross, start documenting in emails you send to yourself.  That preserves a timeline that HR can use

"Your workplace uses you as a means to an end. They need a worker to do work and bring in money. They don't care that it's you specifically, they just want the work done.

Use them the same way. 

Negotiate your salary. Find out how you'll be compensated for overtime before you start. No compensation, no overtime. 

Take your vacation days. *Definitely take your sick days.* (and if work doesn't like that, start sending out resumes and fuck off immediately.) If your employer matches your 401k, stuff the shit out of it so they have to put their money in there too. Take full advantage of those benefits!

"Don't be a pushover and agree to more work/extra shifts just because you're child-free and/or unmarried. It's one thing to generously help out your colleagues who have children/married occasionally but it's another thing if it becomes expected to cover for them every single time. Make sure you benefit from covering for them. 

So for example: I picked up Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas shifts no one wanted because they wanted to be with their kids/families. (Also, my entire family is in the same city I live in so I don't have to travel for the holidays.) In return, I got the summer holidays off from May to September off so I could go have fun in the sun.

Your coworkers are not your friends, no matter how close you are. Don’t mix business and personal. Negotiate and never let any employer undervalue you because they 100% will. When It comes to raises, leave if you’re not paid well. Also, HR is NOT your friend. Be careful what you say to HR in confidence.

"Always put yourself first. Your workplace will surive without you. So many times I have worked with amazing people who put in their all to their job. When they quit I would think ""wow it's going to be hard without them."" But it never was. There might be a day or week or so where things were a bit bumpy but the company always sorted itself out and that person was quickly forgotten. I'm sure there are exceptions but if you're working yourself to death because you think the company *needs* you, stop. Keep your personal time. Maintain your health. Have hobbies. Set boundaries. Don't fall for this trap because you will regret it. 

Don't put up with sexual harassment. I did for years and I have watched young, vulnerable girls go through the same thing. Know your rights and stand up for yourself. If you're in an environment where this behaviour is tolerated, please get out. It's not worth it. Over 12 years later I still struggle with the trauma that caused me.

"I would encourage you to remember that sometimes things might happen to you that are going to be unfair.  And those things suck, and they're not your fault, and you're not a weak bad person if you fail to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get over it, but that often, pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and getting over it is the best thing you can do for yourself.

When you join the workforce, you're switching from an environment that is paid by you or the government to provide you with an educational experience to an environment where they have paid money to invest in you with the hope that you will provide them money in the future through your work.  You should expect to be treated fairly and if you aren't, you should prepare to find a new job and fight for what you deserve.  But you need to go in there with the understanding that your growth and your learning and your health and your job satisfaction, those are all your responsibility.  Your boss is probably going to try to make those things a priority for a while, but they're never going to be their primary concern, and the more you can take the initiative to work hard to get what you need, the better chance you're going to have at success, whether that be at the place you're currently at, or the place you apply at next after you realize that this place sucks but you still want to leave with a good reputation.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qidij5/what_would_you_tell_young_women_who_are_just/hikga3u/,T-Flexercise,female

"This is the most life-changing job advice I have ever received:

When a job ad has a list of requirements, don’t read them as requirements. Read them as nice-to-haves. If you meet many of the requirements, but not all of them, you should *absolutely* apply. They almost certainly want to hear from you! They are almost never expecting applicants to meet all of the requirements.

My dad gave me this advice after the company he works for (a major multinational company) did a huge internal study to understand why they were having so much difficulty getting women to apply for internal promotions. It turned out that (contrary to stereotypes) women were more likely to take ads literally, whereas men were more likely to take ads as *suggestions*. 

As a consequence of this study, the company changed its job ad policies. Now, they only list something as a “requirement” if it is *actually* required—and they now have *way* more women in higher positions. However, the vast majority of companies still advertise the old-fashioned way and call things “requirements” that aren’t actually requirements at all.

When my dad told me this, I took it to heart, and it has served me *amazingly* well. In turn, I have strongly urged friends and family to apply for roles they initially weren’t going to bother applying for because they didn’t meet all of the requirements, and almost every one of them got a job offer.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qidij5/what_would_you_tell_young_women_who_are_just/hilqat2/,Nausved,female

">Is it silly to believe this kind of love exists? And if it does how does it stay alive through life’s trials?

With the disclaimer that Hollywood is Hollywood and no one's perfect, I'm inclined to think so. 

Not a relationship expert by any means, but we're just about to hit 20 years of me having his last name, I'm still into him and I'm like 97% sure he's still into me, so $0.02 for whatever grain of salt it's worth. 

One part is communication, as much as that gets beat into the ground. 

Actually like, talk and interact with your person. That sounds super basic written out, but IMHO way too many couples hit a point where it's like ""aight the husband isn't going anywhere don't really need to try in the relationship anymore"", whether that's a conscious choice or not. 

Keep ""dating"" them, all that shit. Like yeah sure I love the husband to absolute death, he's 100% my life partner, an amazing father to our kids, all that stuff. 

But I really freaking like the guy, too. Spending time with just us two, or doing shit with the kids, it's all sorts of fun experiences and whatnot. 

Secondly, ""getting comfortable within your relationship"". IMHO it's simultaneously the best and worst thing you can do in your relationship, depending on the sense that you're using it in. 

Like at this point, I'm absolutely ""comfortable"" in our marriage, in a security sense. 

He's my other half, he's my best friend, he's ""my person"", life partner, all that shit. There's literally no one on the planet who just *knows* me inside/outside/up/down/sideways like he does. He got my head screwed on straight about commitment issues forever ago, to the point where I was willing to take the insane (for me, at least) leap of enthusiastically legally tying myself to another person with the explicit goal and expectation of permanency. 

At the same time, ""getting comfortable"" is one of the worst things I think you can do, if it's from a ""taking him for granted"" sense..

Might make me sound hyper-neurotic, but I'm someone who's obsessed with always trying to actively be doing something that makes me a better person, whether that's from POV of me being his wife/our kids mom/sister/daughter/boss/employee, whatever. 

Like don't get me wrong, self-improvement is awesome, in and of itself. He's just extra motivation for me - he's a fucking amazing person, I'm still occasionally confused as to how exactly I managed to convince him to sign on to spending the rest of forever with me, and he deserves the best wife/life partner/mother to his kids that I can give him. 

Thirdly, ""like"" vs ""love"" 

Sure, there's people out there who can successfully have some sort of relationship with no real basis in similar interests/personalities etc. If they can make that work, good for them. 

And I know some other people don't like to say that their SO/spouse is their best friend, but I'd just kinda alter that POV a bit. Like sure, I have a ""best friend"", in terms of like, a completely platonic relationship with another lady I'm not related to, but I'm legitimately closer to than most of my family. 

That being said, if you had me make a ""Best Friends in SAPERPXX's Life"" list, he'd be at the top, everyone else is a distant second. 

Like don't get me wrong, I love the man to absolute death. I also happen to really freaking like him, too (at least, like....97% of the time). 

TL;DR 

I'm not claiming to be a relationship expert, but we're coming up on 20 years with the same last name, and I'll be hitting the ""I've been Mrs MarriedName for longer than I ever was Ms MaidenName"" mark just before that. But anyways:

yeah I think it's possible, just not in the Disney way per say.

Disney's on crack with how they like to portray what ""love"" actually looks like, life isn't always perfect and human beings are human beings. 

And like yeah sure we have a house/kids/two ~~small horses~~ exceptionally large dogs/etc together, all that shit. 

But like at the end of the day it's basically a never-ending sleepover that I get to have with my best friend on the entire planet. Sure there's the security of this being a permanent/forever arrangement, I just think it's important to not ""take that for granted"" and still act on the things that convinced you to get into that relationship with YourPerson^TM in the first place.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qii7h0/how_does_a_couple_stay_madly_in_love_for_many/hik1abr/,SAPERPXX,female

"I'm lucky enough to have that sort of relationship with my SO and we've been together for 17 years now.

Two things I think are important:

1. Enjoying each others company. We just really like spending time together. We also share about 90% of the same hobbies which makes life together fun.

2. Touching. Not sex, *touching*. We are always in physical contact. He'll come up and hug me from behind when I'm cooking, we hold hands, we hug. Even just passing in the house often involves touching, just a brief graze of the fingers or touch to the waist or arm.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qii7h0/how_does_a_couple_stay_madly_in_love_for_many/hikboi5/,Wolfdreama,female

"Communicate (especially about boundaries), date and surprise each other like you just fell in love today. The only thing that should ever feel like a routine is trust.

"One of my favorite YouTube channels Cinema Therapy covers this topic.

https://youtu.be/8sFitCMQqV8

The video is based on the book “The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work” by John M. Gottman and Nan Silver, with Morticia and Gomez as an example. 

1. Shared Love Maps: understanding your partner’s likes, dislikes, passions

2. Nuture your fondness and admiration: look for the good things to build and praise

3. Turn towards each other, instead of away. Have 15 minute stress-reducing conversation every day. 

4. Letting your partner influence you. It’s a request, not an order. You don’t have to do it. Treat your partner with respect. 

5. Solve your solvable problems

6. Overcome gridlock 

7. Create shared meaning

I advise watching the whole video because my summary doesn’t have the nuances of the principles. 

My opinion: At an extreme, these seven principles could lead to an unhealthy relationship. For example, it’s good to nuture your fondness and admiration, but that’s not good if your partner is abusive or does nothing to contribute to a relationship. At an extreme, people take this advice and then stay with people they are better off without. The principles are dependent on a healthy foundation.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qii7h0/how_does_a_couple_stay_madly_in_love_for_many/hik1l2y/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

We are very, very close. We have no secrets from each other. We put each other first.

We work together very well. We know how to cooperate.

We argue but resolve quickly. Great communication. Genuine listening, not ""waiting to talk""

We don't argue about small shit honestly.

We take interest in each other's lives and share them with each other.

We have similar life goals.

We are attracted to each other and stay healthy.

We have lots of physical and sexual contact.

"Thanks lol

>and I know that when I get married I won’t get complacent. I have married friends who don’t try anymore because according to them they’ve already secured the ring(which is fine for them) but I want to be the type of woman who still wears makeup, or wears cute PJs to bed or is trying to learn a new hobby or whatever just to continuously improve for myself and for him.

That kinda puts what I was saying more succinctly.

Like IMHO I think way too many people fall into a trap of ""secured the ring now I'm g2g"", even if they don't necessarily do so constantly. 

Don't get me wrong, I completely understand that Life^TM happens. Sometimes that 50/50 partnership ideal swings into unbalanced territory, IMHO the marriage license is you officially/ostensibly permanently agreeing to go balls to the wall in trying to keep that split adding up to 100%. 

I don't really care that much about how other people think I look, generally just kinda march to the beat of my own drum. And he's not the type to tell me to do XYZ with clothes or hair or whatever (outside of like, special specific requests 🤣 in...erm, ""certain situations""), but I do know what he especially likes, so that extent I do take that into account. 

...

I'm also not really comfortable when I hear friends complaining about their husbands/SOs. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand there's some degree of venting/etc that's good, I just think that trashtalking them in front of your social circle is...not the best look. 

Like I get it. The husband's not perfect, neither am I, sometimes we're pissed off at each. But there's just some things that don't have any business being the aired dirty laundry.

>I also firmly believe that you have to like the person you’re with, their character as a human. I guess my litmus test moving forward is “ if I wasn’t fucking or Dating this person, could we genuinely be friends?”

IMHO that's the best way to go about it. 

I've described our marriage as ""hey yeah we're best friends, if best friends had a never-ending sleepover, joint legal responsibility of several small humans, combined finances and frequently got up to X-rated shenanigans together"" before. 

Either people get what I'm meaning or they look at me like I'm some allegedly-codependent alien with three heads, but either way it's 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️, point stands.

Honestly, we just really love spending time together, even if it's sitting in bed reading separate books. We're also very good at giving each other space; he likes to play minecraft in his office, I like to watch netflix and knit, and we're happy doing it. We have common goals, many common interests, common ideals, it just works.

I also just don't really care about food that much. I don't get that satisfaction over cooking my own food or making food for other people. It feels like the worst kind of chore because it also makes more mess.

"Reading. I used to love it when I was really little and my mom read to me, but stopped loving it quite as much as I got older. I would always say ""Being *forced* to read books in school made me hate reading.""

Reading was always a frustrating experience.

I used to list reading,  and walks, and a glass of wine as 'self-care' needs, but thanks to a bunch of people on tiktok, I've now reframed 'self-care' to think of things that actually reduce my stress. Turns out a 10min tidy does way more to relieve my stress than trying to read for 30min in a mess. 

The BEST habit I have is to run the dishwasher every night, regardless if whether or not it's completely full. When I'm waiting for my coffee to brew in the morning, I empty the dishwasher.

When do you think we should leave? Are the clothes you want to wear clean? What time do you think you need to wake up? What time do you think you need to go to sleep?"" to get the thought process in his head. I remind him to do dishes, trash, and laundry.

I did these things for my ex, because once Son was born, shit had to get done. He had to go to work, since we had to keep the baby fed. We couldn't have a dirty house, because newborns' immune systems suck. There were now at least 3 more loads of laundry to do per week (babies are gross y'all). I was too overwhelmed to find a way out until the kid was two years old; I was just constantly up to my elbows in dishes and diapers and laundry.

My current husband does these things himself! When Husband has an early morning, I know it. I hear his laundry going the evening before. He talks to me about when he's going to be setting alarms and taking a shower. And if he wakes up before me, he'll make coffee for both of us. He also spontaneously cleans things on his own, which makes me feel incredibly spoiled.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qiesm9/at_what_point_does_caring_for_your_partner_cross/hikeo47/,insertcaffeine,female

All of this - I am working with my partner on being proactive and taking the lead.  It's not my job to project manage our household - it's exhausting.

"Oh man, this was really a problem for me and impacted my sex life for a long time. I read a few books on the subject that made me realize there's an entire generation of people who experienced this abuse by the church. (Try Shameless by Nadia Bolz Weber or Pure by Linda May Klein) I also worked with both a trauma therapist and a sex therapist to work through the conditioning I'd absorbed and develop healthier views of sex then put it into practice. It surprisingly didn't take very long to undo all that social scripting. Now I'm very sex positive. I am actively working to break the shame cycle so that my child grows up with positive messages about sex and his body.  I also left religion all together but that may not be the right thing for every person.

"""Purity culture"" seems to be a primarily American thing so I didn't experience it myself. However, for anyone who did or is, I can't recommend The Bare Marriage Podcast and their associated blog [To Love, Honour and Vacuum](https://tolovehonorandvacuum.com/) highly enough. The lady who runs it is a Christian but she debunks the awful views that American evangelicals teach and talks about what a healthy, happy marriage and sex life *should* look like.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qi7j7z/women_who_grew_up_in_a_conservative_christian/hiir27p/,Mooncinder,female
"A bit of soul searching and realizing that this was not the sort of life I wanted. Saving yourself for marriage isn't what makes for a good marriage and modesty, purity and devotion won't make up for incompatibility and dysfunctionality. Purity culture teaches young men and women some very dysfunctional views towards relationships and then shames them for any troubles that arise in those marriages that happen too fast and are their first serious relationships (since no dating is allowed, you're either platonic friends or ""courting""). 

Then there's the purity of mind expectations where you avoid learning too much, lest you become too knowledgeable and start having opinions of your own. Life is too vibrant, interesting and exciting not to learn. Anyone whose ego is too fragile to handle someone who might be more knowledgeable on a subject or have some differing opinions shouldn't be my problem. It's demeaning to insist I keep my curiosity in check. It's insulting to suggest men are too fragile to handle women with thoughts and feelings of their own. Sharing knowledge and ideas is an asset, not a hazard. Why should we hamstring ourselves in that respect for the sake of tradition when it benefits no one? 

And I'm not cut out for purity culture. Not just personally, but also for thinking other people should ascribe to it. I cannot summon a level of fucks to give about what what other consenting adults do in their personal lives. I don't want to be shamed about it. I don't want to morally police others. The pressure to do so is absurd. There are so many real problems in the world, why should I waste my scarce mental bandwidth and emotional energy on a manufactured problem that harms no one? It's too big of an ask to have me feel shame and remorse for what goes on in my love life, my thought life and how I dress. It's orders of magnitude too much of an expectation to expect me to judge others in that respect. Life is too short for that kind of shit imo.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qi7j7z/women_who_grew_up_in_a_conservative_christian/hij0s4m/,chonkychonkycatto,female

"My personality is very blunt and i like to tell people how it is, I’ve worked throughout the years on putting a filter so I don’t come off as arrogant because that’s never my intentions but it can be taken that way since i can also be impulsive. Well because I’m blunt and don’t allow people to walk over me, I’ve seen how telling someone “no” , how i honestly feel, or the truth even if it may hurt them can lead to the relationship being tainted or ending

This year that’s happened a lot because the other person shows me their true colours by being upset when I tell them no or how I honestly feel. I never realized it before, but I do NOW understand that it’s not my problem if they can’t respect me, and I shouldn’t be worked up over it

"caring less what people thought in general and focusing on my comfort and ensuring my behavior aligned with my priorities. for example, shaving - I always hated it, it was a time sink, and I already have dry skin, so the process wasn’t easy or comfortable. when I stopped, I was more comfortable, had more time, and my skin issues almost entirely resolved themselves. makeup was a lot harder but it was the same concept - I enjoyed doing makeup but it had begun affecting how I felt about my normal face; I couldn’t go out without it and my best friend joked that she’d like to see me without makeup as a birthday wish since she hadn’t ever seen me totally bare faced since we had met a couple years ago. it was annoying to hold up plans and be late or rush for time because I felt like I “had” to do my eyebrows to look normal. the adjustment period was hard but now I can’t imagine putting the amount of makeup on my face that I used to - and my skin is much better for it. so I would try focusing on comfort and how you want to spend your time and go from there. is it enriching your life and your experiences or is it taking effort and not giving anything back?",/r/AskWomen/comments/qijcfo/for_anyone_that_feels_as_if_they_have_succeeded/hik1nwy/,hensbanex,female

"I know people disagree with them but I found this to be one of the great things about going to an all-girls high school. During my most formative years in learning self expression, I wasn't in an environment full of men. It wasn't overly focused on appearance either, I was always very academic and cared much more about being seen as successful and kind than beautiful.

"Male attention reduced when I stopped wearing makeup or shaving my body hair. I also gave myself a buzzcut. Male attention stopped completely when I began presenting butch altogether. My original reason for switching to masculine expression was to hide from the male gaze, but I find that I really like it, and I'd continue to dress this way even if men went extinct.

As for clothes, I've replaced my leggings with men's jeans, my form fitting shirts with straight cut crew necks, and my short shorts with chino shorts. I've been presenting this way for three weeks. I've only had two men say hello to me, and one man wave to me. Before, the ""hellos"" and ""good mornings"" used to be incessant. The verbal sexual abuse stopped too. When men are biking behind me on walks, they'll say, ""On your left, sir"" instead of saying, ""Nice ass/legs!"" as they ride by. Walkers and joggers won't verbally sexually abuse me either.

But, present however you like, that's just my own experience. Men viewing femininity as an invitation to verbally sexually abuse you is *their problem* and you're not inciting it, even if they treat you like you are (e.g. ""if you don't want attention then why are you dressed like that?""). Men have two choices: to verbally sexually abuse women, or to let women go about with their day. Their abusive behavior is their own responsibility.

(I refer to catcalling as verbal sexual abuse now so that's what I'm referring to. It *is* sexual harassment, and harassment is abusive behavior. Whistling and sexual comments are meant to intimidate and it terrifies and threatens women since we don't know if we'll be sexually assaulted or followed home. I've been followed multiple times, and had a man stalk me and spy on me in my window. I've also been groped. I've had a man scream at me and threaten to beat me when I told him to fuck off after he verbally sexually abused me. Men know we feel threatened, they can play dumb all they want.)",/r/AskWomen/comments/qijcfo/for_anyone_that_feels_as_if_they_have_succeeded/hjfpq1g/,eveningstarx,female

"I grew up on a cul-de-sac street on the outskirts of a large town in South Africa. All of us kids on the street were super close friends and we were all pretty much  glued together. Every day there'd be a pile of BMX bikes outside someone's house. Most popular house was the biggest one on the street. The guy who lived there was super spoilt and had a skateboard ramp in his garden. His parents also had a studio apartment over their garage and it was used as a games room. We would hang out there most days. They had a pool table, a ping pong table, dartboard and Nintendo setup. Best clubhouse ever! It was a fun childhood. 

Equally awesome would be the close proximity to any number of safari parks. My parents liked to get away for a family weekend at least once a month. More often than not this would be to one of the game reserves. Seeing elephants, lions, leopards, cheetah, antelope etc. in the wild is a fantastic experience and one I got to do regularly for the first 20 or so years of my life. I'll always be grateful for that experience.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qif442/what_was_the_best_thing_about_where_you_grew_up/hikf64j/,Wolfdreama,female
"It was a complete shit-hole, and I loved it wholeheartedly. The area I lived in had a fairly high crime rate, it wasn't uncommon to see the police outside my window (thankfully not for us). There was a big grassy area outside with these huge trees which I loved, and it was normal to see a drunk guy passed out somewhere in the grass. I'd ride my bike around the block, trying to avoid the needles that were always scattered down the alleyways. Anyone would think it's the worst place a kid could grow up, but it's hard to explain how much it felt like *home*. The flat we lived in was damp and mouldy, but it was also the place where we had family Christmasses, the living room where I learnt to ride my bike, the place where I'd sit with my brothers and play on the N64 or PS1. No place has ever given me that same feeling of ""home"" as that old flat did.

I've since moved away to another country which is known for its natural beauty, and it's like another world to the one I grew up in. It's hard trying to explain to people the stark difference to where I grew up. Even though the views are beautiful here and life in general is better for me, I can't help but miss the place I came from.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qif442/what_was_the_best_thing_about_where_you_grew_up/hikj1i6/,Elixxity,female

"My XH. He was a human tornado of mess-making. He did not pick up after himself or do chores unless directly asked, and even then he'd do a terrible, half-assed job that would leave me wondering why I even bothered asking. 

I once went out of town for two weeks and came back to what looked like a frat party. The dishes in the dishwasher were the load I had run two weeks earlier. He hadn't cleaned a single dish in two weeks. The sink and counter were full of dishes. The rest of the apartment was littered with Cheerios, dirty clothes and pizza boxes. 

If I asked him to take out the garbage, he'd take it out but he wouldn't put a new bag in. If I asked him to do laundry, he'd bring them back from the laundromat wet saying he ran out of time. If I asked him to vacuum the floor, he'd run the vacuum over the floor and not check if the bag was full first. If I just asked him to clean up without specifying, he'd do nothing and say ""I didn't feel well."" One time he tracked huge gobs of mud all over the apartment like a small, stupid child.

"I am not a woman who is afraid to talk about therapy so I openly sing the praises of it. I have found that my friends have become more open to it once they realize what therapy is for. It isn't a place where relationships are sabotaged -- my therapist asking about my mother isn't trying to get me to demonize her just understand me better through my influences. It isn't a place where I'm blamed. It isn't a place where I'm labeled as hopeless.

It is a place where I can learn emotionally related soft skills that I never had a teacher for (even if I had an adult who knew and could teach, they just never had the time to). That's no one's fault but also here's the lesson and now I am less ignorant yay!

I find the reception to me talking about therapy was the same as when a friend had an issue with a medication and was getting nowhere with her doctor and I said, ""Actually, the pharmacist is the person you want to bring this issue to. This is 100% in their wheelhouse and they can advocate with your doctor for a different prescription because they know contraindications in ways your doctor doesn't."" The friend was like, ""What? I thought they just count pills responsibly."" And I realize that's all the zeitgeist says of pharmacists.

Turned that around, now I'm allegedly a functional RealAdult^TM , I got a solid career that I love, somehow ended up not doing too bad with a bachelor's, the husband and I are super financially comfortable, managing a herd of kids is challenging but rewarding and satisfying.

Pretty obnoxiously proud of pulling all that off. 

Stomach: I was a massive gym rat before kids, had pretty legit abs in my early 20s. 

20ish years and four small humans who started their lives out inside my stomach later, those went away fairly quickly. Nowadays the definition isn't there in terms of actual abs, but it is flat and firm/hard, just with a helluva a lot of stretch marks.

I've always been kind of neurotic when it comes to how I look, with respect to things that I can control. From a sorta vain/egotistical POV, I like the fact that all the time I spend in the gym and watching my diet like a hawk, has some tangible ""proof"", per se. 

And then I've just embraced the stretch marks as life experience.

Face: simultaneously one of my favorites and one of my least favorites. Thanks to the abusive old man, my face kinda looks like Anakin Skywalker and Tom Berenger's character from Platoon got together and had a kid that turned out to be a girl. 

Super raised scars on the side of my face, etc, because why do normal ""child discipline"" when you can just fuck her up with a broken beer bottle. 

(**/s**)

Used to bother me a whole bunch, nowadays it's just a game for me. I'm a super extroverted/bubbly/talkative people person, but those, the whole short-person-obsessed-with-lifting body and tons of tattoos kinda makes me look like a Sons of Anarchy extra. 

I've kind of gotten into the whole ""I'm actually the total opposite of how I initially look, let's see how long it takes people to realize what's actually up"" as some sort of social game of sorts. 

Boobs: We paid for a breast augmentation for me. I was always aware that bigger boobs is a ""grass is greener"" situation in terms of what kind of issues they *can* bring in terms of day to day life, I didn't really care. 

Nature gave me near-non-existent titties that ended up at ever-so-slightly larger than their original size, just wildly deflated and uneven after I got done breastfeeding all our kids. 

Was fucking with my self-confidence enough that a boob job ended up being on the table, now I've got a fairly-noticeably-larger-than-average rack that borders right on the ""aight either those are fake or she's got God Tier genetics"" line, I love how the titties turned out. 

Figured we shouldn't be paying for them if I wasn't gonna be completely satisfied with them, so far no regrets.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qijw9o/whats_your_favorite_part_of_your_body_sexual_or/hijw99e/,SAPERPXX,female

"Doctors who do boob jobs, don't really plan it off ""hey you're at Cup 123 and you wanna be at Cup XYZ"". 

As far as I know, the standard is ""hey you're at Size X, you wanna be at hypothetical Size Y"" and then they plan the implant size off that. It's really dependent on a specific woman's body structure, the sort of look she wants and whatnot.

Like I know a lot of docs who'll be like ""aight screw bra size requests, find pics of women who have the same sort of chest proportions you want at the end of the day, then we'll move from there"" 

....I went from having a small enough chest that they were barely there, wearing a bra felt like an unnecessary cosplay, and what was there after I got done nursing, was saggy/deflated and uneven.

Now I'm just in the ""noticeably larger than average"" range of things.

But ehm, to answer the question. Took two surgeries to get there, babies took me from ""LMFAO why are you even pretending to need to wear a bra"" to a super-deflated, what-was-once-upon-a-time a (bigger) B cup.

"I met my partner when I was 19, never having had a serious relationship before and coming from a toxic household. We both had struggles with mental health, but I don't think I realised how bad mine was until we actually got together, and I found myself not being able to deal with things rationally. Things got really bad in general for me, to the point I realised I needed to get help or I was going to lose things that were precious to me. I started on antidepressants, and that was a long journey as it took four tries to finally land on a medication that helped me. My moods were so much more stable, and I felt like a better person in general. My partner also seeked help for his MH issues and started on medication and going to therapy.

Our relationship has improved so much, and I'm at a place now where I can give support instead of just needing it. It took a lot of work, not because the relationship was bad but because we were two individuals with serious struggles that we initially weren't getting help with, and it's hard to think outside of yourself when you're in a very deep, black hole.

When my husband proposed to me, we dressed up and went to our favourite restaurant. Afterwards, he suggested we go for a walk (this clued me in because he hates walking!) and in front of the cathedral, he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. When I said yes, he opened a bag of Haribo and put a jelly ring on my finger because we'd previously agreed that we'd choose rings together.

"> I think the scenario is missing so much context.

I'm trying to think of a place that accepts coupons that would be a good choice for a first date, and I'm kinda coming up short.

Gift certificates, gift cards, prepaid reservations, prepaid tickets, etc. might make sense, even if there is some kind of discount being applied. But presenting a coupon at the time of payment, on the date, seems like a very specific scenario that I'd want more details about.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qh65aw/how_would_you_react_to_your_date_using_a_coupon/hie33v3/,Globorobohobo,male

"That's odd, I have the exact opposite opinion. In my mind,  a first date is the low pressure, ""feel each other out"" date.    Whenever I made first date plans, I just found a coffee shop (day) or brewpub (night) central to us and went there. Keep it easy and pleasant. I'd be super into a coupon on a first date.

By later dates, if he's into you, he should be planning thoughtful dates (and vice versa when it's your turn to make plans). A coupon for a date that's supposed to be thoughtful, where someone is trying to *pursue only you* instead of trying to choose a partner would be a little sus. There are exceptions to that, too; if it's your absolute favorite place, or if he saved it just for the occasion, or if it's something normally outside the budget... things like that.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qh65aw/how_would_you_react_to_your_date_using_a_coupon/hibo73t/,insertcaffeine,female
">In real life, I feel like most women I know would be turned off by the use of a coupon in the early stages of dating. I’m not materialistic, but **it would probably feel a little tacky to me if it were the first or second date.**

"That doesn't really answer my question, though. I didn't mention the $10 or the $20, I just want to know why people keep saying it's not something you should do on a first date, but the first date is when it's most practical do it because you don't want to do something extravagant when you barely know someone.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qh65aw/how_would_you_react_to_your_date_using_a_coupon/hic4o8i/,KindlyKangaroo,female
"There's also just something different about a physical coupon.

If the restaurant is running a special, or something like a student/military/first responder/friends and family discount, or even if you're a regular and the restaurant up and decides to comp a round of drinks because they like you, that just seems different than a person whipping out a secondary form of payment.

I took this as a first date scenario, as in you don't know the guy very well or at all. In that case, no, I don't want to know if he's broke. That's not a conversation to get invested in unless the relationship has developed and is being invested in.

"I'm quite lonely these days.

My boyfriend is my best friend and my rock. We live together and I love spending time with him every day, and we are very close. However, I still feel lonely overall. I need more than just one person. 

My best friend from high school and I still keep in touch, and I still consider her my best friend. But we are both really introverted, and now that we aren't required to see each other every day at school, I have barely seen her over the past three years. She is a busy person and she is going through a lot of anxiety and mental health issues, so getting her to commit to a day to hang out is like pulling teeth. I have always been patient with her, but I think I'm at a point where I almost want to just stop trying. I'm tired of being disappointed when she can't even make a commitment to me. I have asked what would work best for her, told her if there was a day or time that would work I'd make sure I was free. But she can't commit to anything. She says she is too busy/tired on weekdays, and on weekends she always goes to her sister's house to hang out. The thing is, just for one weekend, even for just a couple hours, can she set aside time for me? She sees her sister every single weekend. We have barely seen each other in person for years. Idk. Just sucks


Also those two people are my only friends. It's super hard for me to make friends. I am a fairly likeable person who gets along with everyone, but turning that into a friendship? I have no idea how to do that. Especially since I'm a very private person, and I'm so introverted and I get overwhelmed hanging out with the same person too much.

"Idk if it is definitively the most embarrassing, but certainly the first that comes to mind. When I used to work in a hotel, they asked me to come in and work on Christmas Day in the family Christmas dinner with one of the guys who was working as Santa. Basically the hotel had Santa presents for all the kids at the family meal, and I was Santas chaperone/helper. I got the kids and basically was there whilst he interacted with them. I assumed they were going to give me an elf costume to wear..oh no. They gave me a red velvet Santa dress with fluffy white trim along the top and bottom. It was somehow too big in places, too shapeless and waaaaaaaaaay too short! It was also strapless - which I did not have the boobs to support. It was awful (plus my bosses complained because it didn’t cover my tattoos). 

In the end I persuaded them to let me wear a really large Christmas jumper that was lying around - kinda as a sweater dress, though it just looked oversized lol - with leggings and a Santa hat.

Circa 2014 there was a trend (here anyway) to wear stuff with flags on it and I went to no uniform day (we only got like 3 a year) wearing a tank top and leggings with the American flag printed on them — not just a logo or picture but the entire pieces of clothing looked like flag.

"Probably, but I think objectification of women is pervasive in society on every level and tacitly condoned and promoted.

"Yeah, but also pretty much every other female supporting character in most major film franchises. Think about the way James Bond himself is portrayed. Or Sherlock in the Sherlock Holmes TV series. Or Walter White in Breaking Bad. Tony Stark in Iron Man.

They’re complicated people with their own personal moralities shaped by formative, life changing experiences. They have their own agency. They break off from the standard rule book and go their own way, mastering their own destiny, striking respect and fear…

"Hmm, where do I start… it’s probably going to be quite long because I will input details for more clarity. 

The very first thing that played a part in getting better was actually getting professional help, and then making up my mind to actually stick with it. This means really taking my meds on time, and attend therapy and truly try to talk about it. 

But just meds and therapy were a very small part of my recovery, the big part of it was actually doing the inner work to acknowledge my trauma that I kept on suppressing for many years. 

I had to really see my pain for what it is to really start moving forward, bit by bit. It was difficult at first, because I had all this resistance come up and my mother who was the main person who traumatised me in childhood kept on invalidating me. 

So I validated myself. At first it actually made me more depressed, because to do that, I had to see that she would never change, and I would never have gotten the apologies I wanted from her and everyone who hurt me. 

But then slowly I started to accept it. Not the it-was-not-that-bad-I-grew-up-fine way, but it’s the “I did not deserve that. Their actions hurt me. It’s not excusable, but I’m no longer the little child who was powerless. I can make my own decisions now. Even though it hurts me to say this and to do this, it is now my responsibility to heal the patterns that were passed down to me that I do not deserve”. 

And slowly, I started to be more aware of how similar I was to my mother. I did not actually see it at first (or I just did not want to see it), but when I started to be conscious of all the behaviours and patterns I am exhibiting, it really terrified me. 

So I started to really see the intergenerational patterns and I was right, the way my mother acted was the way her sister acted. Even though I still get really, really sad and angry occasionally when I thought of how she treated me, I notice that I am able to move pass the feelings because I understand that it was a product of her upbringing, and that was all that she knew, and now she does not have the awareness to change, nor the will to change. 

Then I just started to really listen to my inner voice and inner wisdom. I started to learn about boundaries, interpersonal skills, self soothing etc. 

Then slowly, I found that the days where I spent hating every second of my life and just hiding away from the world by staying inside my house gradually decreased. 

I started to have the urge to explore what I wanted. Started to go out of the house with lesser anxiety. Started to want to go back to school after 3 years. Then slowly my laughter became more genuine and my tears became less bitter. Then I started to laugh and felt okay even after I stopped; as compared to in the past where I felt immense despair after laughing because the suicidal thoughts would come back once I stopped laughing and hope I would never laugh again. 

The change was really subtle at first, but slowly it became really huge. I realised that time started moving again for me. I could finally see that glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. Now it’s really bright, and I would like to think that I have already gotten out. 

I still have bad days (like these days I have been feeling slightly low), and sometimes it can feel like I am back into that dark tunnel. But the difference now is that I know I will see the light again, because bad days do pass. Even a car in the tunnel will not always stay in the tunnel. That’s what I feel. 

It’s really a mixture of self compassion, self forgiveness, self acceptance and self trust for me.

"A few times, years ago. It was with a boy who lied to me about his intentions, while I was trying to make him fall in love with me. One time he was pushing me behind my sexual boundaries and I gave in because I wanted him to like me. That's exactly why I faked orgasming that time with him. I didn't even know what an orgasm felt like back then. 

But after the whole story with that boy, I swore to myself that I would never fake one once again, because if I was going to perform sexual acts, it has to be pleasurable for me too. 

With my boyfriend now I don't even need to fake anything. He always makes sure that I enjoy sex too and he does his absolute best to make me orgasm.

"So many times that I'm not sure how many. This started because people kept assuming I had, and when I corrected people, they responded...negatively. So, I stopped correcting them and let them assume I'd finished because it was fun otherwise.  I also realized that many people asked for honest feedback/direction but didn't *actually* want it; they wanted to be validated on their prowess, technical skill, that they were ""the best"". Lots of people were performatively generous lovers while actually being selfish (doing it for their ego and arousal but not adjusting for each partner). Lots of people are unfamiliar with the mechanical differences in sexual organs, lack technical proficiency, express disinterest in the pre-sex elements that can pave the way to orgasm, and can even express poor attitudes about non-PiV sex being involved in the process. A lot of people seem to think it's solely an issue of direct communication, but I disagree. It's much more complicated than that.

My overall belief towards it is, nobody is entitled to orgasm honesty if they haven't demonstrated they'll be receptive to it. If you're going to respond poorly to that honesty, people aren't going to want to be honest, and it's not fair to ask them to put themselves in a vulnerable position because of the principle of it. You have to create conditions where it is safe to share, and where you won't be 'punishing' them for not orgasming (including indirectly)",/r/AskWomen/comments/qgwdas/how_many_times_did_you_fake_an_orgasm/hibxiw3/,italkwhenimnervous,female

"I appreciate this answer because an orgasm on its own isn't by default huge and mindblowing for me (and on its own, usually more relaxing vs a ""goal of sex"" thing). Lots of times PiV sex is highly enjoyable for me and has more pleasure than an orgasm I'd get through solo play, so when people would get upset I didn't have one, it'd be like... so? The sex was **great**! I had a blast! That's like...idk, candy on top of icecream is enjoyable but I don't require candy to enjoy ice cream on its own. I eat icecream and candy independently, and enjoy them both, without needing the other. Yet I felt like I was being informed I just ""didn't know what I was missing"" even if I literally knew what was 'missing' because I've been able to finish myself in about 5 minutes for the past 20 years haha. I think physical differences in both arousal, orgasm, and post-orgasm experience probably influences the perception of the ""goal"" of sex in this regards, could be wrong though",/r/AskWomen/comments/qgwdas/how_many_times_did_you_fake_an_orgasm/hibzc8v/,italkwhenimnervous,female
"I have anxiety because I know my partner watches porn and that I’m not nearly as attractive as what he searches, and since it’s more effort for him to have sex than for him to just jack off, I cant even enjoy sex with him anymore. I just imagine that he’s only doing it to have a human flesh light when he gets sick of his hand after so long, and makes me just want the sex over with as quickly as possible.

But I was a little bit taken by how quickly she trusted me to babysit, and brought her over to our house (which is not set up for kids at all). I, of course, would never comment because parenting advice from the childless seems bad, but still, it was a bit odd to me how quickly she trusted her ex and me/my husband - thanks for sharing your perspective!",/r/AskWomen/comments/qgliwf/whats_something_you_did_with_past_partners_that/hi8dbbd/,abqkat,female

"Eh, but it’s easy to say you would or wouldn’t do something if you have not experienced it yourself. If you’re not a careless and irresponsible parent then dating as a single mom doesn’t have to be like these examples. Yes, absolutely more caution should be implemented but to not date at all is a bit extreme imo. Not that I’m shaming any single parent who makes the decision to do that, of course, but coming from someone who doesn’t know what it’s like your comment comes off a bit judgmental, if I’m being perfectly honest.

"Hmm I’ve actually always wondered this & I have to say, most likely my childhood neighbor’s son. We met them when they moved into the apartment across from us, the moms became instant bffs so we were always around each other and had a good friendship. He was probably like 6-8 years older but I’ve always been too mature for my own good so I could keep up with adult conversations at 13 (no, he wasn’t a predator but I did have a mini crush on him that I never acted on, of course). 

Fast forward like 2 years, we moved into a house and the one next to us was being rented so we told them since it was bigger and same price almost so they took it. Something happened in between the time they finished their lease and moved to the house and he got into some bad stuff. The mom moved in with the other kids and all seemed well except when he would drop by. He was all of a sudden this abusive and drugged up person. It finally got so bad when he was making threats that she grabbed her kids and ran to our place for safety. She didn’t speak much English so she had me call the police & they came and arrested him. The look he gave me when I was giving the statement to the police officer still gives me chills and he told me I would regret it. 

One month later, he had been out of jail but was just wondering around the whole town. He happened to be walking on the railroad tracks with headphones on and got hit from behind. Died instantly and we couldn’t really be 100% certain whether it was accidental or suicide but I saw him once after in a dream and he was back to his very lovable self. I thought that was it but my baby sister at the time said she would see him around me often.

""How long you live here? You have a boyfriend? Why are you working out? You doing anything this weekend?"" Eventually I told him that I had a boyfriend and I was getting in shape for an upcoming vacation with him and he told me ""You're a fuckin' cunt"" and left, never saw him in the gym again

Went to the gym and wanted to get dressed when one of the trainers approached me and told me I needed a work-out-plan. I told him I don't want one, but he said it's mandatory so I had to fill that stupid paper with him for 30 minutes first. He asked me why I was there what I want to achieve (I just want to run while watching the Simpsons, leave me alone jfc) and picked some excercises for me that I should do every week. I put it in my locker and never touched it again.

Got dressed, went to the treadmills, another trainer approached me ans asked if I need help. Told him 5 times that I was fine and don't need anything. After running for a while ANOTHER trainer appraoched and asked if I needed help with something. I didn't even hear them at first. Had to stop running to politely tell him to fuck off.

"We used to have a black cat.

She was dumped in our garden as a 2 week old kitten with multiple illnesses. My mother took her to the vet and was planning to get her better and then find her a new home. Our vet laughed and said ""you're not gonna give her away, you will want to keep her by the end of this"". 

And indeed. After bottle feeding her, cleaning her, taking care of her and then the other cats falling in love with her, she remained in our house. She was the last of the animals of that generation to pass, when I was 13. 

She was the kindest creature, although a little wary to kids she warmed up to me as I matured and became better with animals (I mean that I learned to not make unexpected moves and read animals' body language).

Just felt like sharing that for some reason, I don't want to let my memory of her fade.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qgmx80/whats_an_animal_that_people_find_grossscary_that/hi96zau/,MEsyas,female
"Off topic but I have a story about black cats for all the black cat lovers: 

When I was 6 I had a cat friend who I nicknamed ""Pitch Black"" he was a stray who lived in the woods behind my apartments. Every day after school, I would put my things on the the doorstep and run to the woods to call him. We'd hang out for hours and I would talk to him. One day my neighbor asked me if he was my cat, I said ""No but he might as well be he's my best friend"" I couple days passed and there were three traps placed in the woods, I tripped them and placed them on the curb, but Pitch Black was still there so I was only a bit worried. I started bugging my parents to adopt him, but they wouldn't budge. I came home from school one day and they had reset the traps but hid them better, I searched for a while but only found 2, I guess the third got him because he was not there after that day. It was honestly a bit traumatic. I used to walk out to the edge of the woods and sob for a long time and call for him over and over. But, flash forward to 2020, I was not in the market for a new pet, I had a hamster and I was fine with that, so I was at Petsmart to get some more food for her, but I felt compelled to go hang out with the cats in the the adoption kennel. When I walked in this one little black cat started going crazy meowing up a storm. I looked at him and recognized my old friend in him, I sat there for a moment, called my fiancé and I was like ""listen up, I am making and impulsive decision but you're got have to hear me out"" and we went back and forth for a bit as he wasn't fond of cats, but I held my ground and he finally gave in. So I left Petsmart that day with my Pitch Black. His first day home he skipped the nervousness and adjustment period completely and warmed right up to us. Since then I have no doubt we were meant to be together, we have a wonderful bond, he's so smart and wildly intuitive, he lets everyone know i'm home before I even pull in. My fiancé and him are best buddies now, we have also since adopted a pup named Tucker and him and Pitch wrestle, Pitch is usually the one on top, its like watching a mixed martial artist and a classic boxer go at it, and Tucker has no grappling skills. Anyways I am very happy with my little family now, I didn't know the hole in my heart was still there until I saw him. Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: Cat I loved as a child was picked up by animal control, not sure if he was reincarnated or what but I adopted a cat as an adult that made me feel like my lost friend was home.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qgmx80/whats_an_animal_that_people_find_grossscary_that/hi8odzn/,lepsybaby,female

"I had one of those.

He was a friend, and one of the kindest and most compassionate people I've ever met. We had some attraction to each other, but were never single at the same time. We did have a one-night stand, and it was freakin' amazing, but that was it as far as romance goes. I figured he was WAY out of my league and only seriously interested in women as pretty and charming as he was jacked and hilarious.

He got married. We still talked a little bit (online, as friends; I'm not here to ruin anyone's marriage, and neither was he).

Then he died. He had an epileptic seizure that lasted well over 10 minutes, became brain dead, and yeeted all his organs out to those in need. (See? Cool guy. Good choices.)

He is the One Who Got Away.

He is also the one who taught me what to look for, and what is possible, in a romantic partner.  Good looks, genuine kindness toward me and all the other humans, and good sex? Yep! It's possible!

"I dated someone in which we shared a friend group. We met everyone around the same time. It sucked when we broke up and I couldn’t vent. Everyone wanted to be neutral and not pick sides. I wasn’t asking people to stop being friends with him; I only wanted people to listen without trying to make me see his side. Dammit, a breakup is not a time to be rational and impartial; let me see it from my perspective for a bit. I had no one to unload my feelings or sadness. 

I vowed to only date strangers after that. Dating apps make that possible. (I will note that going through a breakup taught me how to support friends through their break ups. So, it was a good life lesson.)

When you share friends, you can’t avoid seeing your ex. You can try to avoid them at events and block them on social media, but they’ll still pop up because of your mutual friends.  For the first months after the breakup, it makes things all awkward and friends have to decide which one of you to invite. You need to decide who gets to keep which regular social events. There are always sides to a breakup. People like to say we should all be mature adults and not pick sides. Bullshit, sides always form.

Separately, a friend actually dated him after me. She dumped him when she saw signs of alcoholism in him, the way I did when I dated him. I was exasperated because I had told her that I thought he had a drinking problem, so she knew beforehand. The vindication was greater than the exasperation. Everyone, including her, thought his drinking habits were fine. It was so validating when she thought the same after dating him. It meant I could trust my judgement and I was not overreacting. It was also a life lesson that you can’t warn people about other people. Until they experience it for themselves, they don’t believe you.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qh97sq/have_you_ever_dated_someone_from_your_friend/higiwbp/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

"Quite honestly, that was almost seven years ago and I've been in a relationship for almost six years after that, (which also was a long distance relationship for the first year). 

I can't remember my emotions at the time that specifically, but we were only together for about 5 months, before he called it off. I think I was pretty destroyed, because I had really been into him and the relationship felt really good to me. I was surprised that he wasn't feeling it anymore, and it didn't help that he dumped me over a text, when we had made plans for me to travel to him. I don't know if I'd rather have gone there to be dumped or if I'd prefer he called or something. 

But I pretty much felt like I had wasted time and money on a relationship where the other person didn't make that much effort (I was always the one who travelled) and didn't actually care about me that much. I felt like there was something wrong with me for not noticing the relationship was kind of one sided, although in retrospect, it's pretty clear that his communication was lacking as well.

I don't think anything special helped, just time.

"I don’t know. I never really depended on friends to help me through tough times. I always went it alone or had a SO I could lean on. I’ve had a lot of friends that when they’re in a relationship we don’t hang out as often or at all. But I’m ok with that. We try to find time for each other when we can. But with adult responsibilities it’s hard to find the time. It happens. But I wouldn’t end the friendship because of it. I’d just stop trying for a while and they’ll either come around or they won’t. But I would still consider them a friend, just not a close friend.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qh0bw1/if_youve_had_a_close_friend_who_has_started_a_new/hia1a9o/,mandiexile,female
"Depends, from my own experience, I'd probably respect my friend's happiness, acknowledge that it's unfair to place such a pressure on her and find support in additional places.

Although I have to admit, I've been on the other side of that situation and it led to a point where I felt such a strong emotional burnout plus resentment, I couldn't really talk to her for a year. Our interactions revolved around her issues and I couldn't share my own struggles or even details of my at the time new relationship.

I think she eventually realized how toxic this dynamic was and found additional coping methods, from that point onward, we had a great relationship again.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qh0bw1/if_youve_had_a_close_friend_who_has_started_a_new/hi9qa6r/,Jules2106,female
"Honestly, it would depend on the context and situation. First thing that I would do would be to examine my expectations. What is it that I want from them that I'm not receiving? Why do I think they should be the person to provide that for me? If I can successfully articulate what I want from the friendship and can look objectively enough at the situation to say whether or not that is something appropriate to expect from my friendship, then I can decide what I want to do moving forward. I have no expectation that I would take priority over someone's romantic partner in most situations. If I'm actively in danger and need her assistance, but she blows it off to watch Netflix with her partner, then that's going to be a friendship deal breaker to me. However, if the problem is simply that I don't feel like I'm being placed first or given enough time, it may be that what I need to do is readjust my expectations. Friends are excellent, but they aren't therapists and shouldn't be treated as such. If it looks like I'm pushing that friend to be too heavily engaged in my issues, then I need to step back from that and address it more appropriately with a therapist or counselor.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qh0bw1/if_youve_had_a_close_friend_who_has_started_a_new/hia95ca/,nevertruly,female

Hands down, the best advice I was EVER given was to clearly voice that I did **NOT** want a routine episiotomy.

I currently make over 3x that of my partner and it hasn't caused any issues so far as we both contribute what we can and ensure that both of us can enjoy the incomes.  I offered to pay more than my share of our mortgage/bills but he insisted on being equal so I try to offset where I can by picking up more expensive things like meals out/groceries/holidays etc.  I don't care how much he makes as long as he enjoys his career and we're happy doing things together.  He also doesn't have any sort of hang ups about it where he acts differently about our income which is a huge factor.

"I've dated people who made significantly more and significantly less than me, and never really had an issue.  But I think it's because growing up as a middle class kid in an economically diverse school district, and getting enough scholarships to go to college with a bunch of people richer than me, I really developed the skills to clearly and kindly talk about money.

Be really explicit when you're planning an activity who is going to pay for the activity and whether or not you can afford it before anybody has said yes to going.  If you're the richer one, it's especially important to think hard about how much the other person can reasonably afford before you invite them to stuff, and consider treating them to the activity and explictly telling them that you will treat them.  If you're the poorer one, you've gotta have boundaries about your money, and say stuff like ""It's a stretch for me to fit that in my budget but I'd really like to come.  Do you think we could plan to bring lunch with us so we don't have to eat out while we're there?""

Like, my wife's family are so bad at this and it makes me cringe when they try and plan anything involving money.  Like, her aunts are really high-income, her parents are low-income, and they have these college age kids that they're expecting to pay for when they go out, but my wife is the oldest cousin, and we are, like, married adults with incomes.  The aunts will just plan these family get-togethers that involve travel and nice restaurants and not say a fucking word about who's paying.  And then the check comes, and no one says anything, conversation stops, no one says ""I've got it"" or ""What do I owe you?"" and the two richer families cover everybody and I quietly pay the uncle for me and my wife, because we're freaking adults, but no one ever passes the check to us.  And then, if her parents or brother ever don't go to something, and my wife tells her aunt that she thinks it's because they can't afford it and feel bad about it, they'll be like ""Oh we would have paid for them!  That's just silly!""  And like.... IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY, YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD.  ""DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT FOR DINNER WITH US?  MY TREAT.""  Or, if you don't want to pay for everybody, say ""Hey I'd love to get together with you guys.  Is there a place you'd like to meet up for lunch?""  Let them pick a place they can afford!  Or, if you're the lower income person, you can just say ""I'm sorry, I don't think that's going to be in the budget this month, but let's have dinner at my place some time!""  And yeah, I understand that that's embarrassing, and it's way easier for the fucking rich people to have some grace, but everyone has just picked the worst solution of not hanging out so much and making it awkward.

"My ex spouse used to make way more than me. I was staying home with the baby while they worked, and I thought it was fine. I’ve always been frugal. Turned out, they couldn’t separate it as OUR money, just theirs that they allowed me to access for things like bills and groceries. It was ugly. Even when I made money before staying home, they resented me using THEIR money for things, even though we had a joint account. They could go buy whatever they wanted but god forbid I get a coffee while I run errands. 

In my current relationship, he makes more than I do by far. Soon, I’m getting a massive pay bump that will put me on equal footing and eventually more money than he makes. We keep our finances separate. We split bills 50/50 and anything we have apart from that is our own. We never want to bicker over money, so we don’t involve money in our relationship. No matter how much either makes, it’s theirs to do with as they please, so long as bills are paid.

-Budget/finances: Learning to budget and better manage our money. Working together, and being on the same page for goals, and talking before big purchases.
-Mentality: My husband took some time to adjust to being the only one working and was used to the thinking of it being his money, not our money, and work through changing that mindset of how my contributions changed.

"My ex spouse pays child support. 

My long term partner now will sometimes offer things, like he offered to pay half for of the bicycle I got my child for her birthday. Sometimes he’ll buy a shirt or something for her, or he’ll take her to get some food while I’m working. I don’t expect him to pay for any of the care of my child, though. If he offers, I’m grateful. If he doesn’t, my child is my responsibility. If he were to take on the role of a father to her, I might expect some financial participation, but that’s not how we do things.

The way I see it, he signed up to be with a mom. He didn’t sign up to parent or financially support the child, and I don’t ask him to.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qg73un/have_you_ever_dated_someone_who_earned_either/hi5is7b/,FluorineSuperfluous,female

"Explain to them it is a need of yours (“I really need some alone time. I’ll hit you up when I’m ready to socialize”)

Maybe encourage them to do something too - create, craft, hobby, run, anything else but be with you. I feel like (hopefully) most people would understand. You can’t make your partner happy 100% of the time and they shouldn’t depend on you for happiness - that causes a host of probs. It’s good to be individuals ya know?

So they may feel bad sometimes and lonely and that’s ok. It happens and it’s part of life. Can’t always please people.

And if your partner can’t accept your needs and wants and/or makes you feel bad for having needs and wants, then perhaps you have larger probs.

Take my advice with a grain of salt because I came to terms my mindset is rare a long time ago. A lot of women like to be respectfully approached and complimented and that’s okay. But for me personally I really don’t like being approached based on my looks. I prefer dating in spaces where my personality was the reason we got together or in situations where he was my friend for years and we slowly developed feelings for each other. For example I have a meme page and my ex does too. We started chatting based on that and eventually developed feelings for each other. Humor and a great match based on personality and not looks at all is why we started dating. My ex before that I met online too he commented something funny. Only exception to approaching me would be that one time a guy was buying clothes at my old job and we struck up a conversation because he made a meme reference. He was super funny and he didn’t say anything about my looks at all. It was straight vibes. But again keep in mind this is rare. Just remember to be respectful and I’m positive you’ll get good results with some women,/r/AskWomen/comments/qgp387/what_is_an_instant_turn_off_for_you/hi83k4q/,AvocadoBitter7385,female

"Our mothers were friends before we were even born, so we ended up being close childhood friends by design. As we got older and went to different schools, we grew apart. She was always better (smarter, more athletic, prettier, etc) than me, and I felt like she had left me behind.

In the summer after our first year at university, I reached out to her, asking her to eat dinner with me and catch up. I remember that she got back to me incredibly last minute, and since I was already bitter, it just made me feel worse. While we were eating at the restaurant, I couldn’t hold back anymore and told her how jealous and upset I was about her. We talked about this for a while (including me crying), but ultimately left in a really good, authentic place.

Since then, we always see each other whenever we’re both in town (so maybe twice a year). I’ve learned that she doesn’t get back to texts well, so I value the time we spend together in person. She’s been a good confidant, and I feel like I can share openly with her. We’ve been growing in similar ways through the past few years, and it’s always good to be able to relate.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qglzgl/how_did_you_rekindle_an_old_friendship_what_was/hi7evy1/,DeadWelshKings,female
"Ex Bff from HS and I had a fall out when our friend group fell apart and she felt like I took their side so she started turning people against me in our sports teams. I ended up quitting and taking up clubs to make up for it because I still needed to build up my resume for college. Fast forward 6-7 years, we are both graduated from college and have moved about 6 hours from our hometown. I didn’t know this, I never kept track of her after since I felt betrayed but so had she and she reached out to at least make amends. We talked it all out like adults, not like high schoolers, and we decided to wipe the slate and start clean. We had been friends since middle school so there was lots of history and although we’re not close, we’re still pretty good friends almost a year since she reached out. My other friends cut me off completely tho but we had already grown apart anyway since they all stayed behind in our hometown and had different values & goals than me at that point.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qglzgl/how_did_you_rekindle_an_old_friendship_what_was/hi7ewb6/,YVHThoughts,female

"I did the SAHM thing for a couple years. Turns out it wasn’t for me for this very reason. I personally needed some outlet for my ambition and passions. 

But….. it’s very difficult to find and accept your own self-worth when you’re constantly judging yourself through the lens of “this isn’t what I thought I’d be doing with my life.” 

You are a human being and your self worth transcends beyond what occupation you might have at any given time. Your worth is inherent. 

You have value whether you’re bringing home money or not. You have IMMENSE and VAST value at home taking care of your child(ren) and household. Running a household is a lot of work that so many people underestimate. It requires SO much thought power. You’re a professional facilities coordinator, event manager, coach, accountant… the list goes on. These are valuable skills to take with you wherever you go. And all the while you get to create beautiful bonds with your child(ren) that not everyone gets the privilege of having. You are so blessed! 

Lastly, start with some small gratitude practice. It can be hard if you didn’t grow up with good examples of what gratitude looks like. I didn’t. 

Say something every morning quietly to yourself that demonstrates how grateful you are to have this time and make these memories.

She's in her 20's now and I never did go back to work!

My own mum was also a SAHM and I loved coming home from school to her being there and often my grandmother too.

But I probably wouldn't stay. It's pretty rare that abusers change, and it's a very slow-moving process when it does occasionally happen. I deserve to be in a healthy, happy relationship rather than waiting around for an abusive person to *maybe* change their ways.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qg7oav/how_if_at_all_can_a_relationship_heal_from_a_past/hi4kya5/,celestialism,female
I agree with this and want to add that I think therapy is needed for both parties for different reasons and their journeys would be best handled while not dealing with repairing a relationship on top of unlearning abusive behavior patterns/healing from coercion. the probability that the coercer would relapse or violate the other person again is way too high for the coerced partners safety imo.,/r/AskWomen/comments/qg7oav/how_if_at_all_can_a_relationship_heal_from_a_past/hi4eoly/,hensbanex,female

"Alright, I haven't seen a version ITT that describes my experience so, here's what I wish I'd known.   

I feel nothing about my abortion. Nothing. No happiness, no sadness, no relief, no anger. To me it was very simply a minor medical procedure that passed and I recovered in a few days.   

All I had seen or heard about abortions is that there will be FEeLingS!!! Nope, you may not have feelings. And that's ok.

"I wish that I’d known how great planned parenthood was at making abortions safe and sane. I went there for my first, had a very supportive staff that asked all the right questions (including if I was getting this procedure under duress or if I was being hurt), meds during the very easy procedure (suction using a big-ish syringe by hand which was very quick and not super painful), and lots of support afterwards including antibiotics and a place to rest until I was ready to leave .

I went to a local, supposedly good, hospital for my second and it was AWFUL. Old machine that was loud and hurt a ton, the doctor had obviously not done an abortion recently, they had no procedure or before or after care (they left me on the table in the middle of the procedure to go get some tool they didn’t grab!?!?) and the doctor shamed me about not using birth control.  No thanks. 

Planned parenthood was incredible, and I thank my lucky stars I went there and that they’re doing the work they’re doing in the world. Highly recommend.

As far as emotions - I think about how old my children would be now. But I don’t for one moment regret not having children with the men I was dating when I got pregnant. My life is so much better for not having kids. I went to school and got a masters degree. I have a healthy and wonderful relationship that couldn’t have happened if I had kids. I feel sad sometimes, but not at all sad enough to regret the decision.

"My friend went through an abortion and even then it taught me a lot.  I wished beforehand, I knew the process.  

So based on my friend's experience here was the process she went through in case someone just wants an understanding of it.  Also disclaimer, to anyone reading this and considering this option, please consult your doctor about your specific situation and health.  Every situation is different.  

This is what occurred after she realized she missed her period and it was confirmed that she was pregnant, very early on.  

1. She went to a Planned Parenthood and they conducted a physical and tests to confirm that she was pregnant.  
2. She was prescribed an abortion pill, which they told her would mimic cramp-like, period-like symptoms.  She will start to bleed which was her body's way of terminating the pregnancy.  She stayed home for three days to allow herself time.  
3. She went back to Planned Parenthood so they can do an ultrasound to confirm that the pregnancy was terminated. 


Luckily for her, the abortion pill did it's job.  However, in the case that the pregnancy was still viable, I asked her what would have been her next course of action and she said that they would have to go in and terminate the pregnancy more invasively.  

So in essence, I was educated about the process of how this goes about. It was good to know because I sure as hell did not learn about the process in school other than that abortion is an option and that was it.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qfq7cg/those_whove_had_an_abortion_what_do_you_wish_you/hi4cj0k/,biochemnerd12,female

"Everyone’s already mentioned keto, so….

Frutarianism. It’s exclusively fruit, or mostly fruit with token servings of leafy greens and a bite or two of rice to prevent you from pooping like…..nonstop. Because that’s what such a fruit heavy diet will do. Most of them are super high calorie too because the food is just exiting them about 15 minutes later. And obviously eating 3x the normal amount of calories in JUST fruit is wildly expensive. The adherents I witnessed were like a cult. And yes, this is 100% an eating disorder, at least as I viewed it (maybe reasonable fruitarians exist but I don’t know them), and yes this is what Steve Jobs was trying to cure his cancer with (didn’t work). I’m not an anti fruit person, a lot of diet minded redditors treat it as if it’s nutritionally void candy, which isn’t true, but you can’t eat just fruit. 

A few years ago, there was a fad for these pre-made juices with activated charcoal as a “cleanse” or a “flush.” One, they cost about $60-100 a day, and it was *literally* just water, fruit juice, and activated charcoal. Ingredients that at most extravagant cost like…..$10 a day if you buy them at the store. It was *so* expensive for so little money’s worth. Two, we all know that cleanses and flushes aren’t necessary or real. Your body isn’t a toilet, you can’t “flush” the fat or “toxins” out. Three, activated charcoal is…..not exactly *dangerous* on its own, but should be ingested with extreme caution because it can absolutely make any medication you’re taking ineffective, and it simply isn’t necessary for day to day tOxiNs, whatever they are.

"A lot of my meals consist of a meat (fish, chicken, etc) and a couple vegetables or a salad. Veggies like zucchini, green pepper, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, asparagus, are all pretty low in carbs. For salads I like doing caesar salads, or I do a garden salad with any other dressing that is 1-2 carbs a serving (southwest ranch!). I've grown to really like riced cauliflower, which I cook in a pan with some chicken stock or a little butter, and then salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic. The majority of my carbs in a day come from my vegetables. I avoid doing too many condiments to leave more room for the good stuff. Sometimes I'll do heavier meals like butter chicken w/ riced cauliflower, or spaghetti squash with some tomato based sauce and ground beef, but most days it's just meat and lots of veg.

My breakfasts are often a low carb yogurt with a few raspberries and some low carb granola. I'm in Canada so my go-to for that is Danone's Light & Free plain yogurt, sweetened with a few drops of vanilla creme Sweet Drops, and half a serving of Farm Girl granola (expensive but it lasts me almost a month and it's delicious). I also do a lot of omelettes or frittatas (cheese, mushrooms, tomato, lots of spinach). 

I drink mostly water, but in the mornings I'll have coffee with a splash of cream in it.

"Because I’m not my dad.     

My dad used to stop and pick up hitchhikers a lot. He’s about 6’0, rough blue collar looking guy, very friendly but not someone you want to take advantage of. He’d pick up hitchhikers as long as he had a seat to spare in his (work) vehicle. I remember him picking up an exchange student from Nigeria once who was lost and didn’t speak our language very well, it was winter and he wasn’t dressed very warm either. Dad gave him a ride to where he needed to be (uni campus), and threw in a spare set of gloves and a hat for him too.      

My dad always taught me to help others out whenever I can. He’s not naïve and knows how to read people/their intentions, and wouldn’t hesitate to give the shirt off of his back to someone who truly needs it. Dad also told me to never pick up any hitchhikers, especially if I would be alone in a vehicle. As a woman, it simply isn’t safe.       

I’m not a rugged looking blue collar dude like my dad - I am a young woman, and while I’m fit I’m definitely not strong or skilled enough to defend myself from an assault.

They were walking along a relatively rural road and were more than 5 mi in either direction from the nearest town. It was a hot day and they looked exhausted. It was entirely possible that they could have been murderers looking for victims, but It was fairly unlikely.

I'm in my mid thirties now, but back when I was in my mid-late twenties I only knew of a few people my age that lived with their parents.

"In the US, I’d say about 4 or 5 of my friends aged 28+ are currently living with their parents. 

Only 1 does so completely by choice, and intends to do so until he gets into a serious enough relationship that warrants cohabitation. (You’d be right in predicting that none of his relationships have made it that far…) This friend makes enough money and is a stable enough individual to be able to manage living on his own, but it’s common in his culture for boys to live with their mom until marriage. His brother is doing the same thing.

A couple do so because they had a rough patch during their early 20s and had to return to living with their folks out of necessity.

A couple more are coming out of a breakup with their partner whom they cohabitate with and so are living at their folks’ house while they get their ducks in a row to move back out again.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qfk8yu/what_percentage_of_your_friendsacquaintances_are/hi12yel/,hugship,female

"I’m in the US. Very few. For reference, I’m in my early 30s, though I have friends as young as their early 20s. 

So many factors get forgotten when people present this as an issue exclusively of finances, or an issue exclusively of American parents “expecting” their kids to move out (IMO, a completely fictitious myth). Most of my peers live with partners, married or otherwise. Some of my peers have children of their own. The majority of my peers spent at least some time living alone or with roommates during college; no one wants to go back to mommy and daddy breathing down their neck when they’ve already been on their own. Plus, not everyone’s parents are supportive people. That doesn’t just extend to parents who would kick their kids out. Why would an adult want to live with a parent who is overbearing, controlling, or worse? I know a *lot* of parents who’d be happy to have their grown kids move back, when their kid simply doesn’t want to under pain of poverty, even if they’re on broadly good terms. 

A huge factor? Almost no one I know lives in the same city as their parents. My peers’ parents are in their fifties at youngest. Many are retired. They can afford to live in dead one-horse towns 45 minutes from the nearest wal mart, or in rapidly contracting rust belt cities, or a trailer in an adults-only village, or out on a farm or mountainside somewhere. Those of us in our twenties, thirties, and forties don’t have that luxury. We have to go where the jobs are (and frankly, we want to go where the culture is). Even if our parents live in areas that do have jobs, why would we leave the jobs and friends we already have to save a couple of bucks living in their guest rooms?",/r/AskWomen/comments/qfk8yu/what_percentage_of_your_friendsacquaintances_are/hi25g6h/,TerribleAttitude,female

"It's honestly better to avoid doing this. You don't know if a total stranger is dating someone else or even into your gender at all. I personally can be attracted to total strangers unlike some commenters, but I wouldn't act on it. There can be safety risks involved if you barely know someone and most women hate cold approaches. Some straight women also get threatened and can put you at risk for homophobic reactions as well. 

I do like to wait to know someone. Not for attraction reasons but for comfort.

"The context and situation matter a lot. 

If this is just randomly in public and that person is a total stranger to me, then I wouldn't. I find the entire concept of approaching someone just because you find them attractive to be really weird. I don't like being hit on randomly while I'm just trying to exist in public, so I certainly wouldn't want to make another woman feel that way.

If I was in an appropriate social situation, I would talk to them and get to know them to see if we enjoy each other's company. If we build a good rapport and clearly enjoy each other's company, then I might ask them out on a date or just to go get some coffee and hang out to get to know each other better.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qg2wc1/female_attracted_women_of_this_sub_if_you_wanted/hi3ut2i/,nevertruly,female

Online, just send a message? I hate dating apps, though. I used to like OKC because you could know more about a person, but ever since they got bought by the evil conglomerate that once was Match, which now owns almost every dating app out there which is why they all fucking suck.

"My husband bought me an inexpensive blender because I was looking for one to buy myself. I was recently told that dairy and soy have been contributing to some issues I've been having, and it's made it a lot harder to find meals I can eat (and when I trip up and eat them, I definitely notice and regret it). Breakfast has been especially difficult because I only like to drink when I wake up, not eat. I've been really into smoothies lately though! And having this blender has been a game changer. It was only $10 but it blends my frozen banana together with my other ingredients and the only thing that isn't smooth is the oats or flax seed (whichever I choose that day, usually ground flax) and I love it! I'm glad to have a way to still have a delicious, easy breakfast drink.

"(TW for talk of eating disorders)

I didn’t know it at the time, but I now recognize that I had an eating disorder from my sophomore year of high school, through my first couple years of college. I pretty much forced myself to be keto/low-carb for almost 8 years. I was a happy person overall, but I was NEVER content with the body I saw in the mirror or in pictures. Not to mention I was always tired, cold, and susceptible to colds etc. 

Now I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been, but I LOVE to take selfies, try on new outfits, and of course, eat delicious food with my husband and friends. It took way too much time to get to where I am now, but I can say that self love is loving not only the person you are, but also the LIFE that you lead and the experiences you have.

"For me it's about being kind to yourself, respecting yourself and treating yourself the way you want others to treat you. 

The amount of times I used to tell my friends not to accept the shit treatment they were getting while simultaneously allowing toxicity to walk all over my life is astounding. But I had no respect for myself. ""I can't do/don't deserve to do better so why bother"". This stood for friends, family and ex partners. 

Take that time for yourself. Learn a new skill, go for a nature walk, play a game, watch a film or a show even if you've seen it a hundred times, have a candle lit bubble bath, listen to your favourite music (whether it's from today or 10 years ago), get a massage, a tattoo, a spa day, go shopping! Whatever brings you joy, do it and do it all for yourself. Hell, I started my journey of self love by putting a picture of five year old me on my mirror. Everything I hated about myself I had to try and say that to a (pictured) child. If I couldn't? Then why am I saying it to myself? since the only difference is twenty years. 

It's corny, I know, but it was something I'd plucked out of some random clip I saw. My fat diary I think it was called? Except the therapist had her envision that child on the chair.

That being said… I can’t help but think that in this hypothetical scenario, where suddenly *every* world leader is a woman… there certainly would have to be a surreal moment of pause for each of these women to take stock of how momentous it would be.

"Unless that also came with the complete dismantling of the patriarchal power structure in place throughout the majority of governmental structures, little to nothing would change.

* Is it for fun because you enjoy it? That's not okay with me. Getting enjoyment out of hunting and killing animals is not okay for me. It may be a necessity, but finding it enjoyable is a red flag for me.
* Is it part of a necessary conservation and population control effort? In situations where a particular species has increased beyond the bounds of the location to support them in such a way that overpopulation is causing damage to the species, then conservation efforts to balance the population of the species with the available resources are acceptable to me.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qezp8c/what_is_your_opinion_on_hunting_animals/hhwgdoz/,nevertruly,female

"I've been trying to figure out how to explain it, but I think it's just that there's no reason to call it out. No drama should be the default setting. And if you're calling it out, then there's usually a reason why you would choose to particularly highlight that aspect. Like, it's such an unprompted disclaimer (as someone said below). Or like, when someone says they're a nice guy, maybe they're not really all that nice.

And no, I wouldn't describe yourself as impatient. Describing yourself in negative ways can be off-putting on a first impression.

"This is why I just can't really get into anime, even though I've tried.  Young women (sometimes even those who are supposed to be middle school-aged) are so often sexualized.  I've also noticed a weird trend where the characters are drawn to look cute and almost childlike while still being sexualized.  And in the most popular anime the women often seem to be relegated to the role of background character or love interest (ex: Naruto).  Newer ones seem to be getting better, at least, but it's still hard to sift through them.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qemizn/what_otherwise_good_tv_show_was_ruined_for_you_by/hhxdtaw/,saturnsun_3,female

"It was her birthday and she was making a point about how Ted brought total strangers to important, friend-only events before he was truly serious about them. Teds being unable to remember their names yet the women being forever in important event photos was the punchline, and Marshall pointed out that Ted was treating the women really poorly by making the relationship seem more important than it actually was by including them. 

Don’t get me wrong, a lot of the show has aged poorly, but There’s a lot of subtle writing that suggests the show knows how awful Ted is. A theory is that since Ted is telling the story, he intentionally makes Barney out to be absolutely heinous and almost a satire of a playboy, because Barney is Robins ex husband (the woman Ted is still pining for over decades.) The whole plot misdirection even suggests that Ted engages in a lot of the behavior he claims Barney does.

"My best advice is to find yourself a real estate agent and mortgage officer that you really trust. Interview people to find out how often they work with single buyers. I personally choose to work with women who had bought homes on their own because they understood the different perspective a woman might have.

I purchased a home married then got divorced and did it on my own. I was approved for a mortgage much higher than I actually wanted to spend because as a single parent, financial security is my biggest priority (and because irresponsible lending practices still exist!)  My agents understood this and were so patient with me when I had questions or had anxiety. My mortgage agent said ""I'm not going to tell you how high the bank set your limit unless you want me to.

"* There are more men attracted to women than there are women attracted to women. It's always going to be easier to find a man interested in women than to find a woman interested in women.
* In my experience, men are the door-to-door salesmen of the dating world. There is always one trying to sell you on themselves and ask you out. It's more work to avoid them than to find them.
* Women into women have to deal with homophobia, potentially biphobia, being gal-palled, so it can be harder to even find out that they may be interested or open to dating other women.",/r/AskWomen/comments/qf0387/bisexual_women_do_you_have_an_easier_time/hhwk5lk/,nevertruly,female

"\-Access to tools and systems. In my world (tech) most systems have certain engineering owners - this database here, that one there, this AWS service here, this code repository there. Male engineers, especially white males, pretty much can freely obtain whatever access they wish, push whatever code they want, full and unlimited access. As a woman, if you want to do the same, you have to go through a whole approval process, hear things like ""well it's not secure if we give this to you"" and a host of other lame excuses. This is rampant and the status quo at most small tech companies and startups where there are not formal processes.

\-Layering. If a male manager is not succeeding in his role, the default is often that ""he's just not getting the support he needs, let's open up a new role to report to him"" but for women the default is ""we need to hire someone to manage her and help prioritize"" so someone is hired over her.

I recently had my first time on a halloween party. I was drunk and just casually asked for a kiss, and we went to his room. I had my first kiss as well, but it didn't really feel as good as I thought, I had no butterflies or whatever and it actually got boring after some time.

https://www.thehotline.org/identify-abuse/power-and-control/

Emotional abuse is part of the Power and Control Wheel:
- putting her down (mocking your swing)
- making her feel bad about herself (everything you mentioned)
- calling her names
- making her think she’s crazy (when someone feels “sensitive”, it means someone is rubbing them the wrong way. However, it’s often minor and each action could be explained. Which makes one feel “crazy”.)
- playing mind games 


https://www.thehotline.org/resources/types-of-abuse/

You may be in an emotionally- or verbally-abusive relationship if your partner attempts to exert control by:

- Calling you names, insulting you, or constantly criticizing you. (Saying you’re not athletic. Mocking your swing.)
- Humiliating you in any way, especially in front of others.
- Gaslighting you by pretending not to understand or refusing to listen to you; questioning your recollection of facts, events, or sources; trivializing your needs or feelings; or denying previous statements or promises. (If you discuss your feelings with him and he brushes it off as he is “just making a joke”, he’s trivializing your feelings.)

Separately, have you asked your mother? While I dislike asking someone to fix their partner’s messes, marriage means someone is financially tied. They may share a joint account.

"You feel unsafe. That alone would be sufficient for me to move. However, you say you cannot afford to move.  

There are two issues:

1. A disturbance occurred next door. According to the police, it was a “domestic disturbance”. Based on what you described, it could be true that it was domestic abuse.  Domestic abuse is absolutely terrifying. I grew up in a household in which “domestic disturbances” happened a lot. There was a ton of yelling and shouting. My father broke down doors and my mother’s religious altars. My parents fought viciously when we lived 5 people to a bedroom in an apartment. My parents did this when we lived in a huge house in an expensive new neighborhood. The neighborhood didn’t matter. The issue was between them. (Since I had to live through it, I never thought about how scary it could be for neighbors.)

Let’s assume it was a domestic disturbance and not a robbery. If it was, it will absolutely happen again.  Can you live next door to a couple who are domestically violent towards each other? They will absolutely fight again and you will have to listen to whatever destruction they bring on each other.

2. Your fear/anxiety seems to be rooted in the violence happening to you. You fear that the police lied and it was a robbery. What makes you think it was a robbery as opposed to a domestic fight? Did you see someone running away with an item? Did you hear they yelling about the location of an item? Did you hear someone screaming about an object? 

Do you know your other neighbors? Is there a history of break ins or home invasions in the neighborhood? Ask your landlord if there are breakins in your neighborhood. Ask the cops for the statistics. You need more facts to make a decision. 

Is it fear based on fact or anxiety based on conjecture? The facts you provided is that there was a noise disturbance next door. You called the cops. The cops said it was a domestic dispute. Then you leapt to the conclusion it was a robbery. (People could have lied to the cops and claim it’s a domestic abuse when it’s a robbery because they want to hide the robbery, but that’s not the presented facts.)

You need to do your own assessment and figure out how safe or unsafe your neighborhood is, and whether you want to stay. If it is domestic abuse, can you live next to the cycle of violence? We are not in your situation so we can’t say whether you should stay or go.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/ql2sln/i_had_to_call_the_police_on_my_neighbors_and_now/hj1yuvs/,ConsentfulCuddles,female
"To keep the habit, still go to the gym, but plan on a lighter workout. Say you normally do a full body lifting routine at the gym. If you are having bad cramps, still go to the gym and instead maybe do some lighter BW exercises and some walking on the treadmill. Sure it's not as intense a workout, but it will help you keep the routine. Routine is there for you when motivation is wanes.

"I just want to validate that what you have noticed is real. All of my friends who have gone from obese to smaller have discussed how differently people treated them. I strongly advise you to talk about this in therapy.

One friend shut people down and didn’t accept comments or compliments about her body. She dove into the body positivity movement such as HEAS (health at every size). Another friend sought the compliments and attention, and it morphed into an massive eating disorder. She found validation in receiving positive attention for the first time in her life. There was comorbidity with another disorder, but she eventually went to in-patient treatment.  It’s why I say to bring it up in therapy now, before it gets worse. 

Society rewards thinness and it can create conditions to nuture an eating disorder. It sounds as though your eating disorder was physiological, but it could turn into psychological. I have had an eating disorder and I would never wish it on someone. It is hard to turn down positive attention.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qk7qx3/i_22f_recently_lost_weight_and_am_now_the/hixfxez/,ConsentfulCuddles,female
">  I can't exactly answer ""hey congrats on getting thin"" with ""thanks my meds make me depersonalize and starve myself"".

If you don’t want to say this because you don’t want to share personal details, it’s fine. However, if you don’t want to say this because you don’t want to be rude, then I say you can say this. It should embarrass people enough that they will think twice before they bring it up again.  They are making personal and invasive comments. You’re allowed to say something personal in return. 

> Like me losing the weight lumped me in with the same people who treated me like crap.

I understand this is a feeling you have. However, I want to direct your focus elsewhere. Are there average sized people who have treated you the same before and after, negatively or positively? Are there people who are still indifferent to you? It makes sense that you see how many people are approaching you now, but there must be people who leave you alone. Also, I want to point out that not every average sized person is a jerk. Just like not all fat people are jolly, not all average sized people are mean. So, you can be one of the not-mean, average sized people. 

> This change in how people treat me if terrifying.

I just want to give you a hug. 

> I'm so suspicious of everyone's motives because ""they wouldn't have approached me when I wasn't this way"".

This should be addressed in therapy. 

I won’t sugarcoat it: unfortunately, this is a part of being a woman, especially one who fits conventional standards. 

Don’t give into your fears and anxiety. Ask yourself , “do I like this person?” If you were fat, would you like this person? Observe how they treat others around them. Give them a chance if you want. If they treat you nicely and laugh at fat people, then you know they’re not worth your time. If they treat you and everyone nicely, then they deserve your time. 

It’s unfortunate that they only saw you when you lost weight, but this is your current situation. You need to live in the present. The present is giving you opportunities to meet people. You can say no to them; that’s your decision. Being conventionally attractive means you will meet many people with ulterior motives. You will need to learn how to distinguish them from the ones who will be your actual friend. It’s a process that many women go through regardless of size. It’s just the volume differs based on our size and closeness to conventional beauty standards. 

> I'm still in this state where what if it's a joke and everyone is making fun of me. 

There are a few ways to handle this. 

1. Say “I prefer that people do not comment on my body”, possibly with “I have a negative history with my body and etc”.  I do this with people who I have to talk to every day such as my friends or my coworkers. 

2. Say “thank you” and then move on. I understand how a compliment feels like they’re making fun of you, when it was a way to make fun of you in the past. All you can do is assume they’re being sincere. They think you look good. It’s their opinion. They can think what they like. If they persist in trying to get your attention, walk away. 

3. Ignore them. You owe no one your time or energy. Don’t give them your energy. By getting upset, it’s giving them something. Acknowledge that it makes you angry and why, and then move on. Don’t ruminate in your thoughts.

I will note that compliments are often used to manipulate young women because we are taught to be polite and to respond to compliments. It’s a way to capture your attention and to start a conversation. You have the right to not engage and to not get stuck in a conversation with them. You can just ignore them and keep walking.

I also want to warn you about negging. You will likely encounter it more now. Negging is a backhanded compliment. “You’re so pretty that you probably don’t want to talk to someone who looks like me.” It’s a tactic in which a person compliments and then say something negative about a woman. Then she feels compelled to stay and prove them wrong. If someone says something that makes you want to prove them wrong, it’s a trick and you should just disengage.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qk7qx3/i_22f_recently_lost_weight_and_am_now_the/hixgp8a/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

"Start with a moisturizer with a high SPF sunblock.

I love oil of Olay SPF 15,  https://amzn.to/2ZM6SKm  but I recently found one that was spf 30 and reasonable. https://bit.ly/3jT3LqX (Walgreens)

This makes your foundation go on very smoothly. Use a foundation brush.

If you are over 40, don’t wear face powder. It enhances wrinkles.

Next, a blush that is close to your skin color. This makes it subtle. Don’t use too much.

Eye shadows depending on your complexion. I wear a cream color on my lid and brow and a brown in the eyelid crease. Use a small brush for the crease to blend. Use a blending sponge to blend the whole eye.

I use brown crayon-type thin line eye liner. I do a line on the top lid and a half line on the bottom from the outside in. These are not dark heavy lines.

Here is what I use. It’s important to use waterproof with oily skin: https://bit.ly/3GGBLk7 (Ulta)

For a more natural look, don’t use eyeliner.

If you have oily skin, Google “tube mascara.” This won’t make raccoon eyes. Use an eyelash curler and apply. 

This is what I use. It’s one of the only ones I’ve found that isn’t under my eyes by the end of the day: https://bit.ly/3GHyyR5 They have it at Walgreens and Target.

Use Cover Girl outlast all day lipstick. Find a color that is natural to your skin tone. A bit darker makes your teeth look whiter. https://bit.ly/3nPoQ6R (Walgeens, CVS)

No matter what. Never sleep in your makeup.

Always wash and moisturize.

"I battled ED for basically all of my 20s. Not severe ED but I had disordered eating habits and body dysmorphia. At around age 28/29 I realized that my body was actually good at letting me know when it was hungry. I started eating more 'intuitively' but I did a lot of work changing my sociocultural mindset about body image, beauty standards, and food. So I stopped using social media, avoided looking at triggering content, distanced myself from my fitness addict type of friends because they have the same problem themselves but aren't ready to deal with it yet, I started doing yoga, journaling, practicing meditation, all of the typical eye-roll things. They do actually help. Also did food prep, got into cooking, gardening. I have a new mindset about food now because I see food as nourishment, an old medieval word for food is ""bellytimber"". I see food as bellytimber now and don't have an obsessive love/hate relationship, no longer starve myself, no longer binge. It's 99% psychological, I truly believe that our bodies let us know when we are hungry.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qjjbo0/when_you_want_to_eat_your_feelings_what_do_you_do/hiql6nc/,patriziostar,female
"Avoid your trigger foods like the plague (those foods that once you start eating you can't stop). Don't have them around in your home - availability is the main problem. When you feel like snacking on unhealthy stuff just have something healthy instead (like a fruit or a granola bar). As soon as you start feeling snackish, head out for a walk. See how far you can go, and try to go over that mark the next day.

"If you can, take a water bottle and go for a walk. It takes you away from the food, and if you sip the water bottle you may end up not hungry because you were just dehydrated. It can also give you time to refocus your emotions. Either by thinking through the problems or by listening to music you enjoy, reading, an audiobook etc. If you're still hungry when you come back get a *small* bowl of whatever snack you're craving and force yourself to wait an hour before you have more. Also while you're doing this make sure you have structured meals. You're far more likely to snack if you don't know when your next meal is!

Edit: also it's nearly impossible to just *not* snack. You need to be doing something else. So e.g. to fill the hour before I want more food I make myself do chores or things I know I need to do, that way I also feel like I deserve the snack if I'm still hungry after an hour.

"Herbs are super easy to grow. You can grow them in pots indoors. Growing veggies requires more planning but it is easy and cheap as long as you plan things right. You generally need about 100-200 square feet of garden space to feed 1 person. It depends on the vegetable. Some of them have to be spaced out more and others don't need that much space. Most vegetables need about 6 hours of sunlight but it varies. Root vegetables can do well in shadier areas. The general rule for watering is that plants need 1 inch of water per week, from rain or watering. You can watch some YouTube videos for ideas or check out r/gardening.

He immediately came back with ""I'm actually seeing someone."" The thing was, so was I. I was just interested in a friend to eat Thai food with and said as much.

"It's easy to see from the outside what your friend should do. There is more to it than just telling someone in an abusive scenario that they should leave.

Firstly, when you speak against their abusive partner, their automatic response will be to defend them. You are unintentionally creating a Them vs. You dynamic, unfortunately making their relationship stronger.

Secondly, they need to make the full realization themselves. You should do your best to talk to them in a way that they put the pieces together, it will be more effective than telling them what they have to do.

For example, I was in a bad situation. I talked to my friend about how bad it was, but I ended with ""but we had a talk and I think it's going to get better."" And his response was, ""I haven't talked to you in a year and I think you said the same thing last year?"" Not in a mean way, just in a way that called my attention to the pattern and it was a massive light bulb moment for me.

"> 1. Telling the guy I am a virgin

For a different perspective, one of my friends was a virgin until her late 20s. She was saving herself for marriage and then decided not to. She had sex for the first time with a random guy she picked up from a bar. She didn’t tell him she was a virgin. 

> 2. Telling the guy to be very slow and gentle

Tell him “I prefer sex to be slow and gentle.” If someone says they don’t like sex that way or they try to rush you, leave. You don’t need to have sex with them. 

> 3. Being inexperienced, doing it wrong?..

Do what feels good to you. I don’t have advice for this. 

> 4. Also, am I supposed to be completely clean shaved or just trimmed, what's the normal norm?..

Pubic hair is a personal choice. Some women are fully shaved, some have a full bush, some are in between. It’s up to you.

5. You ask about where to go. My advice is go to their place, if you know how to get there on your own and you know how to get home on your own. It is much easier to get up and leave someone’s house than to try to force someone to leave your house. Plus, then they don’t know where you live if you don’t want to see them again. 

Someone asked Dan Savage, a sex advice columnist, this question and he said to go to their place. If they do something bad, they need to clean up the evidence in their house.

"Since you’re inexperienced, I have two resources I want to point you towards:

1. Look up the Blue Seat Studios video of Tea Consent. Basically, consent is like tea. When you say yes to tea, you can change your mind even after someone makes you a cup of tea. If you said yes to tea yesterday, it does not give someone the right to show up to your house and make you drink tea today. If you start drinking a cup of tea, you are not obligated to finish the tea. If someone went on a long journey to pick the tea for you and used special water to brew the tea for you, you are still not obligated to drink the tea. Sex is the same. You can change your mind. Consenting to it does not mean you are consenting to sex forever. Even if someone took special care and set up a really romantic evening, you still don’t have to have sex with them. 

2. Read Emily Nagoski’s book “Come as You Are.” It’s an excellent book on women’s sexuality. It goes over the anatomy, psychology, and our cultural environment of sex. I wish this book existed before the first time I had sex. It would’ve save me a lot of heartache.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qhdr0f/going_to_lose_my_virginity_soon_at_24_scared_need/hicwaim/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

"Your concerns are legitimate because you have those thoughts and you feel them. No one else can live your life. You need to pay attention and listen to your own feelings and thoughts, because you will need to live the life you create based on your choices. 

When it comes to dating, my advice is date the person they are today. Not who they could be if certain things happen, not who they are on their best of best days, but who they are every day. 

Even though you’re not fighting, couples counseling is good advice if you want to continue dating him. Resentment is a hallmark of a relationship in trouble.  When you feel resentment, it needs to be addressed and therapy is a good space to do that.  

Do you want to marry and have kids with someone who doesn’t have income at 26 and won’t take care of the kids? If he won’t be the primary income and he won’t take care of the kids, then what is his role in your relationship? Do you want to end up being the person making the money and taking care of the kids? You would basically be a single parent, plus another adult in the house who you need to take care of too. 

I rented a room from a woman who is in that situation, and I felt bad for her. She was sweet, kind, and generous. She worked all day, came home and did all the housework, cooked dinner every single night, helped the children with their homework, and put them to bed all by herself. She supported all of them with her teacher’s salary and renting out rooms in her house. The husband did nothing. He ran a business from home but in reality, he hired day laborers to do his work. He never helped with the children, he didn’t cook, he didn’t clean, he didn’t help with homework. When his kid needed eggs for a baking project, rather than walk to store and buy them, he took my eggs from the fridge, from a tenant who paid him rent. He was so lazy. 

Slow: your boyfriend will always be slow. It has been three years. He has not and will change. You need to either accept it or move on. I used to hate it when people are late, but I learned to tolerate it from friends. At one point, I sat down to think about one of my favorite people. She’s kind, generous, a good listener, supportive, optimistic, but she always shows up an hour late or cancels half the time. I decided that remaining friends with her was more important to me than her always showing up. However, she is someone I see a few times a year and not every day like a significant other. I still will not tolerate lateness or flakiness in an significant other who I would spend much of my time with. That is something you need to determine. Your boyfriend is never going to be a fast person. You have to accept him as he is now, which is someone who is slow, or you need to find someone who is more your speed. 

I will ask: do you truly love him or is this a habit? Do you want to stay with him because you like him, or because you’ve already spent three years with him? Many people stay in relationships that do not suit them because it is what they know and they don’t know how to move on.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qgq7fn/am_i_overthinking_or_are_my_concerns_with_my/hi9ny0o/,ConsentfulCuddles,female
"Do not try to push your niece into doing something she's clearly not interested in doing.

Once she feels like she can trust you and that you accept her for who she is, then she may be more open to doing things with you that you and your family like to do. Just don't force it.

I was the exact opposite when I was a little girl. I was every bit a ""tomboy"" and the more my mom pushed the ""girly"" things, the more I pushed back and focused more on sports, being outside, etc... It hurt me and our relationship that she would not accept I liked more stereotypical boyish things and just let me be myself.

"That's fair. Your post came across very differently though. The point of my comment was about getting your niece to trust that you care about what she likes and accept her interests without trying to force on her things that you would prefer her to like, if you understand what I mean? 

People tend to have biases towards their own personal interests, so it requires some self-awareness to make sure you're not inadvertently forcing what you want to do on your niece. On the side, you should do things with her one-on-one that cater to her interests, not just try to come up with something that includes your interests.

The princess wagon is a great idea. If you like being outdoors, you could also do some play acting that requires dressing up in costume and going on an adventure in the woods (do a typical fairy tale with dragons, fairies, and princesses or something along those lines).",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qh1yza/how_can_i_be_more_involved_in_my_nieces_45_years/hib9m2y/,moosetopenguin,female
"First, women are people. They operate like human beings. 

Second, work is work. Many of us women prefer to keep our professional lives and personal lives separate. 

Third, life does not owe anyone a significant other. I say this as a woman who has been single for most of her life. Your rants make me concerned that you’re going down a path in which you believe that life owes you a girlfriend, and thus rejection makes you angry. 

Fourth, what do you have to offer a girlfriend? I’m not talking about looks or money. I'm talking about personality, hobbies, interests. You want a girlfriend. To attract a girlfriend, you need to offer more than a desire to have a girlfriend. What makes you you that would be attractive to someone else? I'm not asking what does the Internet or social media say is attractive in a man. What are your interests? What are things that you like to talk about? What are things that you can talk about that someone would want to listen to? In order for you to attract a girlfriend, you need to be a fully rounded person. 

For example, I am an introverted person who spends most of her time alone at home and posts on Reddit. I took up running so I had something to talk about with people at parties. I took up snowboarding because it made me interesting. I like snowboarding for other reasons including it's active, outdoors and in snow, but it making me interesting was a huge plus. I try new things and go out of my comfort zone, because I like being around people who are open to new experiences. Whoever you want to attract, you need to make yourself worth their attention. 

Stay true to yourself, and work on your rough edges. For example, I used to be a pessimist who would overthink things. The pessimist part bothered me so I worked on becoming more positive. I accepted the overthinking part when I found people who like me for it. So you need to figure out what you want, how to attract those people, while staying true to yourself. 

Stop wasting time getting mad about rejection. Start figuring out why people are rejecting you. Focus on other interests. Note: all you need is one person to like you. You may and will probably face a lot of rejection until you find that person. I did not find people who appreciated how my mind worked until I was in my late 20s. Until then, I pursued my interests, made friends, felt out of place, and kept trying.

Also, don’t think it’s because you haven’t dated or because you’re a man. Women are rejected all the time but you don’t hear us ranting about rejection by men the way men do about women. I’ve been rejected for my weight, ethnicity, and lack of femininity. I have written tons of first messages to people on dating apps and have heard nothing back. I just move on. When someone is not interested in me, it’s fine. It’s their decision to make. Yes, rejection sucks and it stings, but it happens to everyone.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qhec2v/rant_i_dont_be_fully_understand_how_women_operate/hiceseo/,ConsentfulCuddles,female
"As for this situation: there is nothing to do. She’s your coworker. That’s it. Treat her like any other coworker. Unless she laughs in your face and makes fun of you in front of others, there is nothing to do. You asked (via a friend) if she is interested, she said no, end of story. 

> I was thinking this could actually be my big break 

I associate “big break” to people trying to enter an industry. Like someone wants to be a model and they get a big break when a casting agent sees them in the mall. I wonder if your word choice is an indication of how you view relationships. Relationships are about making a connection with another human being. Getting a big break makes dating sound like a job or a competition. 

>Why did she flirt with me why did she say stuff to me that made me excited to ask her out in the beginning what was the point to piss me off.

I want to draw a distinction here. Her actions led to you being pissed, but neither you nor I know that was her intention. Again, your wording catches my attention. When I see what you write, it seems as though you are saying that she did it on purpose to piss you off. I doubt she did it to piss you off. Do not assume malicious intent in other people’s actions. Assuming malicious intent is a sure way to make a person become enraged and bitter. 

It is natural for you to feel a large negative emotion when you are rejected. It is expected for you to feel pissed when our society trains men to only feel anger. However, do not assume her intentions are to make you feel poorly. In other words, it’s ok to feel your feelings but do not assume that people are intentionally trying to trigger those feelings. When you assume everyone is an asshole, then all you will see is asshole behavior. Instead, take a step back and assume people have neutral intent. It will be easier to deal with rejection when you assume neutral intent. And if they are being an asshole, disengage.

You don't need to enjoy EDM or be a good dancer to attend a party.

"Unfortunately... These things happen. And truthfully some men believe themselves when they say they don't want a relationship until a woman comes along that they finally see themselves with. This isn't a slight on you in the least! He was up front with what he desired and unfortunately stupid human emotions got in the way and you wanted more. **That's totally okay**. There is NOTHING wrong with you. Hardly anyone stays with their first sexual partner for life or even for long nowadays. I know it hurts. And I know it's easy to blame yourself. Here's the thing. You will *never* be the perfect match for everyone. There are some people you would be an absolutely terrible match to. And that's totally fine. You simply weren't what he was looking for. But you **will** be what someone else is looking for.

Dating right now is a minefield and even moreso on tinder. I believe the average amount of serious relationships women go through before marriage is two, and the total relationships are 7 ish, not including individual dates, one night stands or friends with benefits. You're still quite below the expected and you would have had to have been incredibly lucky for your first time to turn into one of your two ""alotted"" serious relationships lol.

Basically - this is normal. You are allowed to feel guilty, and any emotion you have is valid... But know that it is not your fault, and honestly... It might be a long road until you truly find what you're looking for.

-this is a common one people say, but clear nail polish. once again, you’d have to hide it, but just putting it one is really nice. i put it on to protect my nails sometimes and i feel very fancy when doing it.


-similar to the last one, grow out your nails. do a bit of nails care like filing. i also have a cuticle moisturizer from lush because my cuticles get really dry in the winter which causes them to bleed so i use it to soften them. once again, you can just pass it off as a moisturizer. but it helps with that delicate soft feeling 


-picking a gender neutral nickname may help a bit (for example, if your name is john, go with jo).


-workouts online exist for slimming or thickening some areas. try out those a bit. 


-conditioner that helps with volume is a miracle worker. hair is fluffier. certain ways of drying your hair with a hair dryer can add more volume and texture. i know i use it a lot because my hair is flat.

Most of my male friends have had a lot of success on dating apps. I would try making a profile on a platform that suits what you're looking for.

Make a profile that tells a bit about yourself and what you're looking for, include a variety of pictures of yourself that clearly shows what you look like (not just selfies), and if you initiate a conversation, don't open with just a, ""Hey"" or ""What's up?""

"Do you have any friends older than you? It helps to be around older women who are positive and happy. Much of our media (movies, shows, books, magazines) are focused on people in their teens and 20s. Life goes on after 30 but we don’t see it as much in the media. So it helps to have older friends. It’s living proof that you can have a fulfilling and happy life at any age, not just at 22. 

Yeah, aging sucks. Your body gets slower and your friends start dying. But aging is also great: you take less bullshit because you have less time for bullshit, you get paid more to do less depending on your industry, you’ve made enough mistakes that you won’t repeat them. Also, you learn who sticks around because of who you are, and who stuck around because you were young and hot. 

It’s similar to being young. Being young can be great because your body is faster but the pressure of “live life to the fullest” sucks. As you get older, you get to live life however you want. There are good things and bad things about every stage in life. Don’t get stuck in the past or the future. Enjoy the now.

"First, accept that you have feelings for him and don’t judge yourself for them. You have them. The next step is what to do about them. My advice is tell him and see what he says. Maybe he feels the same way, maybe he doesn’t. Then your options are:

Options if he says he doesn’t feel the same way:
- break up so you can get distance from him
- keep seeing him, while understanding that nothing will ever happen. No marriage, no serious relationship, etc. 

Options if he says he feels the same way:
 - break up so you don’t get confused
- keep seeing him and see where the relationship goes 

If he mocks you for catching feelings, or makes you feel bad for having feelings, or says that you were trying to trick him into a relationship, break up. He doesn’t have enough emotional intelligence to deserve a fwb. 

I have done both options. 

Keep seeing: With one guy, I knew it wasn’t real love. My feelings of “love” intensified after the sex so I knew it was because the sex was so good. He made me laugh, was a good listener, and we shared the same financial values. We had a few conversations about my love for him when I started feeling feelings for him. He was always clear that it was mainly sex between us, we could be friends and do stuff like try scuba diving together, but it would never end in marriage or be serious. To emphasize it’s a fwb situation, he had a rule that when we met up, it was to have sex. If I didn’t want sex, I didn’t show up. (To be clear, if I showed up and something happened in which I didn’t want sex, he didn’t force me either. There is still the friends aspect of being fwb.) It worked with what I wanted at the time. I was focused on my job. I wanted the trappings of a relationship (mind-blowingly great sex and having emotional support) without the work of a real relationship (me being his emotional support, considerate of his feelings, or carving out time for him). He was respectful with my feelings, was a good emotional support, and we both dated other people. So, this situation was FWB with one-sided feelings, and the clear understanding we’re just friends with benefits. 

Break up: I had another fwb in which I really liked him.  This guy was also clear that he didn’t like me back but he didn’t treat me the way the other fwb did. This one never reached out to me, and would talk glowingly about other women that he dated. When we had the conversation about my feelings for him, it seemed as though he wasn’t into me even as a friend. Even though the other guy was never going to give me a serious relationship, he emphasized he was fwb with people whose company he enjoyed. This guy didn’t give me that same feeling; he never spent time with me outside of sex.  I saw him for several months until I realized that I was hurting myself to see him. Each time I saw him, I felt stupid and dull. I felt like I was disrespecting myself. So I stopped seeing him. It wasn’t even a break up because there was no relationship to break up. I simply stopped reaching out and he never asked if I was ok. 

So my advice is, have a conversation with him. See how he treats you. See how it makes you feel. Then decide whether to keep seeing him or break up. There is no right or wrong decision. It really depends on how the situation makes you feel. From an outside perspective, my two situations sounded similar: I had feelings for the person, and the person made it clear that they didn’t have those feelings for me. However, one situation was good and worked for me, and the other situation hurt me and had to end. 

If seeing him makes you feel good before, during, and after, then keep seeing him. If the sex is good, you feel good, and the person makes you feel good, then it’s fine. As long as you don’t set yourself up for an unrealistic future, I don’t see the harm in it. If it makes you feel like a stupid person to keep having sex with him, then the situation is not right for you and you should stop seeing him.

You need to be honest with yourself. Do you want a relationship based on sex that will never end up in marriage or a so-called “serious” relationship? Are you truly ok with whatever parameters this situation has? If you’re not, break up. If you do want a serious relationship, then don’t hurt yourself by doing friends of benefit.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qb009f/what_is_some_advice_you_would_give_someone_in/hhadlen/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

"How do I (F20) deal with being passive aggressively bullied over lies?
So it feels really odd that this is even an issue, since I never really experienced bad bullying growing up in any way. I made friends with this girl, C, (F19) about 2 years ago through work. Eventually we started hanging out and everything seemed great and fun! Until we got to college and I realized she actually never went out of her way for me, and she would just flip a switch and start ghosting me randomly over small things. This whole thing shook me because I really wasn't sure what I did, and anytime I tried to bring it up she would ignore me again. 

I also met my boyfriend, M, (20M) through her. He is her boyfriend's, S, (20M) roommate, and they've been friends since kindergarten and are in a band together. She started saying terrible things to me about M everytime I saw her, stuff about how S was starting to hate him for not having a job at the time (which only lasted 1 month), and just very degrading comments that I know C meant to upset me with. Eventually, when I got questioned by M about saying hurtful things about one of his and S's friends, R (20M), I confronted C about it. I hadn't said anything terrible about R but she had texted S that I did anyways. 

She pretty much told me that she thinks I've changed as a person and that I was making all of my boyfriend's friends hate him. When I questioned S about this, he said that C tells him everytime I shit talk M (which I don't do since I love him and have no complaints). S also told me that he doesn't hate M and isn't mad at him. I told him C was lying about things, and S pretty much just said ""she wouldn't do that"" despite everything we talked about.

This devolved into a huge fight where C said some really nasty things to my face. C also freaked out at me for hanging out with a girl she used to be friends with (this girl never did anything to C, it was C who decided to get everyone to start bullying her). I told the girl that C was pissed at us for hanging out. Eventually though, everything settled down.

About 2 months ago I decided to finally be done with C, as she started ghosting another friend and I over going to a thrift shop without her. About a month after I started ignoring her, she sent me a huge wall of text about how ""she's the one who distanced herself from me after she found out I lied to someone she cared about,"" (direct words). I didn't know what she was talking about until S told M it was about me ""lying"" to C's exfriend about C being mad at us for hanging out back in DECEMBER. It was not a lie, and I even have screenshots of a vague post C made about this girl for hanging out with me.

I decided to not respond and fully block C on everything, and I hadn't even talked to her since August. Regardless, C has gotten S and R to believe her about this lie. It seems like such a ridiculous issue to be mad over in the first place, but for some reason S and R just get angrier at me as time goes on. I am trying to interact with them as little as possible, but it is difficult since my bf lives with S until next August. Everytime I'm over there lately, S says passive aggressive things to me like calling me a snake and talking loudly about ""how much he hates people who talk shit about people behind their backs and try to turn their friends against them."" This is the only way I can even guess at what C has been telling them. At this point I know she is a shameless liar, and that S and R will believe anything she says (despite her also saying really degrading shit to S all the time).

Keep in mind that I haven't said a single rude thing to C, S, or R throughout this whole thing. I have absolutely refused to address it as well, since I know C was trying to bait me into a fight with her. They're starting to take it out on my bf too though. S says rude shit to me in front of my bf, which pisses my bf off since he's not a confrontational person. S and R don't talk to him anymore or invite him to things and I know they're trying to punish him for not breaking up with me over this bullshit.

I would avoid C, S, and R entirely by just having my bf over at my place, but we live about 1.5 hours away from each other and his car is on its last legs and he can't afford to have it break down.

I'm pretty sure I'm being bullied, and I don't know what I can even do about it. At this point S wouldn't believe either of us about C lying. The thought of saying shit back to them makes me so nervous I wanna puke, and I honestly am worried about S trying to physically fight me or M. So what can I do to stand up for myself that won't make things worse?

TLDR: This girl I used to be friends with is getting her boyfriend to bully me and my bf over things she's lying about. I can't just avoid them, and they're making it hard for me to ignore them. How can I stand up to her and her bf without making the issue worse?",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/qarjmi/how_do_i_f20_deal_with_being_passive_aggressively/,TreatHot6042,female
"Thank you for the advice! He's currently going to school in the city he lives in, and is still in a band with S so it'd be very difficult for him to move in with me, although I would let him. My bf already has a place lined up as soon as the lease ends at least, with another band mate who has always been super nice to me. I'm not afraid of S just up and punching me, but I feel as though if I do anything to try and stick up for myself it might lead there. Almost everything S says about me is technically indirect, so I feel even more awkward about speaking up. It just sucks because everytime I say nothing I can feel it eating away at my self esteem. I will try and work out an escape plan with my bf for dealing with S and C when she's over there though.

"Condoms absolutely have a size, and disappointingly that's not taught in sex-ed, even where decent sex ed is taught.  Usually we're taught that condoms are a one size fits all, and that since it can stretch over an arm it's fine on a penis, but that doesn't take into account friction.  Saying that the condoms don't feel quite right for you might be a good start.  You may also just say that you noticed it doesn't look like it fits quite right and you want him to have the best pleasure he can.  A properly fitting condom also prevent breakage and slippage, meaning safer sex.  As for measuring, there's whole websites devoted to how to measure, and with charts of condoms and their sizes to match.

"I know this isn't exactly what you asked, but it could still be helpful if condoms (or discussing them) continue to be an issue:

**I may be wrong on this so nobody flame me**, but I *think* you can use spermicidal gel/foam or dissolving spermicidal films in addition to him wearing a condom.  It might be an unnecessary redundancy, but so long as both are used correctly (strict adherence to the instructions included), I don't see how it could really cause any problems (unless one or both of you is very sensitive down there or are abnormally prone to pH imbalances or UTIs).  That way, even if some semen *does* escape the confines of his condom, the spermicidal stuff should reduce the sperm motility, so they'll basically get stuck in the spermicide until your body flushes it out as it would with normal discharge (as vaginas are ""self-cleaning"").

If you see a gynaecologist, make sure to ask them these sort of questions, and don't hold back -- it'll probably be a bit embarrassing for you, but it's their everyday line of work and they're usually pretty happy to answer these questions, especially in personalised cases like if you have PCOS or are taking certain medications that could interact with hormonal BC.

"First thing is to relax! Therapy brings up all kinds of feelings so try to keep yourself present. 

Your first appointment is basically a get to know you. The therapist will ask you why you're there and questions about yourself and the events leading up to you seeking therapy. 

It's also a good opportunity for you to ask your therapist any questions you might have about them or the process. It helps to write them down before hand if there's something you're anxious about or want to make sure to mention. 

In therapy you want to feel safe and comfortable. If you find that after a couple of appointments you aren't feeling that, then that's OK. Not every therapist is a fit for every person and they won't be offended if you seek help from someone else. 

For me, I'm a people pleaser by default, so I have to be aware at all times that this isn't school and I try to keep myself aware for when I am doing something to please someone else rather than for me.

Question to ask yourself: do you want to marry this guy and have his kids someday? That is a possible future if he does not want an abortion. If your answer is not an enthusiastic yes, then you need to think about if you want to take that risk. 

I would end a relationship because to me, there is nothing to discuss. This is not a fun debate over whether a hot dog is a sandwich. This is a life altering decision of whether we’re going to raise a kid for our entire lives or whether (in his perspective) to kill a child. This is deciding whether to take on the risks and burdens of a pregnancy for nine months, and then the lifetime financial, emotional, and physical work of raising a child. If I get pregnant, I will get an abortion. Unless we’re in a relationship that is on a marriage-and-have-kids path, I am not going to debate whether I am getting an abortion. I am getting an abortion, period, full stop. 

It’s an essential point of compatibility. If we don’t agree, then we shouldn’t be having sex. The pro-life person will feel resentment if they have to in their mind “kill” a child, and the pro-choice person will feel resentful that they are forced to raise a child they feel unprepared for because their partner made them. An unexpected pregnancy will absolutely wreck a relationship if the two people disagree on how to handle it.

What does support look like to him? This is an imperative topic to discuss, especially as many states are trying to make abortion illegal. Depending on your state, will he be willing to take on a legal risk to help you get an abortion? Even in states in which abortions have not been made illegal by stature, will he help pay for the abortion? Will he help you find a place to get an abortion? Will he take time off of work to drive you to get an abortion? Will he take care of you after the abortion, without judgement? Or will he expect you to deal with all on your own?",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/q6wmbk/should_i_end_it_solely_because_of_differing/hgf0m6d/,ConsentfulCuddles,female
"I’ve read your other comments so;

- Right now you don’t want to get pregnant but not sure about in the future

- You see yourself having a future with this guy and he has no other red flags. Not sure if this is even a red flag as he says he would just want to discuss it once (and hopefully not bombard you with anti-abortion stuff)

I’d say have a discussion about if you both want kids in the future and how you would go about it (you said you might not want to birth them). So you both know what you want. And say right now (and for the next few years) you don’t want kids. See where he stands as this would indicate if he’s desperate for kids now you’re probably not compatible but if it’s you he wants (kids would be bonus etc) then he might be a keeper.

Hope that helps.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/q6wmbk/should_i_end_it_solely_because_of_differing/hggavcu/,RaiLau,female
"For me it would depend on his other characteristics. My husband and I have been together for 25 years - he is pro-choice but also anti-abortion in that, he doesn’t feel it is the right thing to do in anything other than an emergency situation because a pregnancy is still an innocent life. I am solidly pro-choice although I wouldn’t take the decision lightly. We had a scare and I had to take essentially morning after pills (we used BC, but I thought I was on my period because of spotting so we skipped it that time and my period stopped.  We were still in college so I took the pills even though the chances I was pregnant were very small.  He was a very good nurse through the cramping and nausea I experienced and we never fought about it. 

The thing is, my husband respects me and my decision making ability. He is always willing to communicate and have a vigorous debate on things where we disagree.  He is also very loyal and caring - and to me those things outweigh a disagreement on abortion because he isn’t a strict and controlling kind of person.  He also very much took an active role in preventing pregnancy through our entire relationship, probably in part because he knows how adamant I’d be about not having an unwanted child. We had two planned children and then he signed up for a vasectomy as soon as we decided we were done because I don’t tolerate hormonal BC at all so every month was stressful while we waited for aunt flo.  Even now in our late 40s, if his surgery magically reversed itself and we got pregnant, he would prefer to have the child and just deal with it. I’ve made it clear that at my age I was NOT going through another pregnancy and we are both glad it is an unlikely scenario. 

In the scheme of things, the one time we had to confront that difference we were able to do so in a civil and living manner because of the type of person he is. Those qualities carried through our  25 year history and has been something I can rely on in many situations.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/q6wmbk/should_i_end_it_solely_because_of_differing/hgfui8w/,jeanakerr,female

"My advice: no, absolutely not. Do not keep dating him. 

I give this advice because women are so often told to give a guy a chance. This is how people end up in relationships in which they don’t even like each other. End it now. Listen to yourself. Don’t listen to your friends or the guy who likes you. It’s OK if you change your mind on your own, but don’t let your friends’ opinions or a man’s like for you persuade you to keep dating him. It takes two people to be in a relationship. It is insufficient when only one person likes the other. 

There is a story I tell myself when I need to break up with someone who likes me a lot. A man really liked a woman. She didn’t like him but he begged her for a chance. They kept dating and he realized it was infatuation and he did not love her. Before he told her that, she discovered she had a terminal illness. He kept his mouth shut, remained faithful, and took care of her to the end of her days. He regretted asking her to keep dating him. He thought it was so sad that she spent the last days of her life with someone who didn’t love her and who she didn’t love. It’s a bit morbid but I repeat this story every time I need to break up. If I don’t like someone, they deserve to be with someone who likes them in return. 

If you want to read the original source, the story is in the introduction of “Shit My Dad Says” by Justin Halpern. His father tells him that story. It’s a humor book of Tweets of stuff his father said. I didn’t realize the introduction would have a formative impact on my dating life. Don’t waste someone’s life on being nice.

"I see red flags and no, I don't think you are overreacting. I think you should sit down and have a serious conversation with him when you are ready. Tell him his relationship with this person makes you uncomfortable and that you felt like a third wheel during her visits. You need to go in with the knowledge that you cannot tell your boyfriend what to do, or what relationships he can or cannot have. You can only tell him how you feel and see if he can do anything to reassure you, such as posting pictures with you, setting boundaries with this person etc. 
This also bothers me:
>I guess my biggest fear/anxiety is this is someone he’s had a long time crush on/feeling for but she’s never been interested back but I also don’t want to be an overly jealous gf.

This is an issue if true. If he has unresolved romantic feelings towards this person then he is emotionally cheating on you. It may even be worth asking him if he ever had a crush on her or dated her. 

I don't know about male/female friendships. The only guys I hang out with are my husband's friends. I've never had a guy friend that did not want to sleep with me.

"Be honest and set clear boundaries: “I have something to ask you. I was wondering if you’d be interested in cuddling in a platonic way, as friends. To be clear, I’m not sexually attracted to you but I feel very platonically affectionate towards you. I miss being hugged and cuddled. It is absolutely ok if you say no and I won’t bring it up again.” 

I hate to be jaded but you need to approach your women friends and not ask your men friends. I’m a highly touch-oriented person. I used to host cuddle parties with my friends because I had so many friends to cuddle. All the single men I cuddled with one-on-one became sex partners. There are various me factors for why that happened, but it happened with my men friends and not with my gay women friends. 

How did I make the leap from friends to cuddle friends? It started with one friend who asked me. We knew we were not each other’s type. She was feeling sad once and asked if I’d be willing to cuddle. We cuddled. I became open on social media about cuddling friends and it just continued from there. Lots of people want platonic touch. My friends know I like to cuddle and it doesn’t mean sexual interest. It also helped that I hosted group cuddle parties so it set expectations of “we just cuddle and that’s it.” To be honest, it was luck and meeting people who like to cuddle and understand boundaries. 

You can also go to formal cuddle parties (if you’re in the US). They’re a bit pricey and too formal for me, but they are good exercises in platonic cuddling and boundary setting. It’s also a safe environment because there are professional moderators. It’s a good way to meet people who like to cuddle and understand boundaries.

"To be gentle: you said the right things to her, now you need to live them. 

Why do you need to know what happened? Why do you need to know the conclusion? Let me give you a spoiler: often perpetrators do not get charged, do not get punished, and they live fruitful and fulfilling lives. Often the perpetrators are not affected by what happened and probably don’t even remember the incident. They’re probably seen as an upstanding citizen, a good neighbor, and a loving partner. Life is not a movie. Justice is often not served when it comes to sexual assault. You absolutely cannot ask her these questions of what happened to the guy, if he was punished. When you ask those questions, you could be re-traumatizing her. You could be reminding her of how he was never punished and how he was never stopped. You may make her feel guilty for not reporting him if she chose not to. You need to understand, often when people report, it affects the life of the reporter more than than the life of the person who was reported on. The person who reports is given the burden of evidence, whereas the person who was reported on is assumed innocent unless proven guilty. The reporter is painted as ruining his life, while the accused is martyred and held up as being brave to withstand such accusations. 

You need to carry this burden for her: this burden of not knowing, of not knowing details, of not knowing what happened to the perpetrator. What you’re feeling is a fraction of what she has lived and will be living for the rest of her life. The chances are very high nothing happened to him. 

You cannot ask her to traumatize herself for your edification. As someone else said, you need to talk to a therapist about it. There is no way to tactfully ask these questions of her and you have no right to ask her. You have to take her lead as she decides what to reveal to you. You cannot take her autonomy away from her.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/q5nuln/my_girlfriend_revealed_she_was_raped_how_do_i/hg76coo/,ConsentfulCuddles,female
"If you want to understand the perspective of an assault survivor, I suggest you read the following books which helped me understand:

- Know My Name by Chanel Miller. She was the Emily Doe of the Stanford rape case. It’s from her memoir that I learned that reactions like getting angry on their behalf, wanting to punish the person that did it to them, is not helpful. It’s making the assault about you rather than about her. It forces your girlfriend to comfort you rather than you supporting your girlfriend. This book also gives the first-person account of what happens when someone does report. It is because of this book that I do not believe reporting is the only correct reaction to a sexual assault. Because of this book, I never guilt women into reporting. While reporting can be good for establishing a history and building a case against a perpetrator, it does not resolve the trauma of the survivor nor guarantees punishment of the perpetrator. In fact, it can add to the trauma. 

- Hunger by Roxanne Gay. Her memoir starts with her being gang raped at 12. It is devastating and it shows that it never gets better. It affects her for the rest of her life. All you can do is keep living. In the end, she mentions she has looked up the boy who was the leader of the gang rape. He was successful in life. This book is why I say you cannot ask her what happened to her attacker. It may make her wonder what happened to him and look him up. It can be painful or traumatizing to discover that he has a loving wife, happy kids, and his life went on fine while hers is a wreck after his actions. Do not add to your girlfriend’s pain. 

- A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America by T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong. This was a Pulitzer winning investigative journalism article that was expanded into this book and later adapted to the Netflix series Unbelievable. It’s about a young woman in Washington who reports her rape, and then she recants it. Many years later, a different police department find the serial rapist who started with her. The book shows how the WA police department mishandled the case from the beginning because they investigated with the belief that she was lying. They had no understanding of how rape affects people differently. This book is why I say you don’t ask her whether she reported. From this book, I learned that there is no standard reaction to surviving rape. Not everyone reacts the way you see in movies. Not everyone is visibly traumatized, not everyone is visibly scared.

"Since this is an advice forum: my advice is change how you think about your body rather than changing your body. Accept that the body you have is the body you have. The way our fat distributes across our body cannot be changed, despite what some advertisers and products will claim. 

Thinking negatively about your body will only take you down a bad path. Negative feelings worsen over time. I say this as someone who was “healthy”, who exercised and ate healthy all the time, until it escalated into an eating disorder. And it started with being dissatisfied with my body. 

My concern is that you’re talking about your body shape the way many women’s magazines (or whatever the modern equivalent is) talk about women’s bodies. That our bodies can be categorized into fruit shapes and that we have wear certain items to flatter certain parts of our bodies, which means we cannot be happy in our bodies. What is wrong with being an apple shape as opposed to a pear shape? What led you to that belief? Why are our bodies compared to fruit, a consumable item? 

And since someone will want to jump in yelling health, well use your blood pressure as a measure of your health. Not weight or body shape.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/q457f1/who_has_had_any_body_shape_changes_after_18_can/hfybjzd/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

"Yes, this girl sounds not great. But the real red flag for me is that your bf isn't being respectful about your feelings. It's one thing for your bf to not see eye to eye with you but it's another thing for him to see you uncomfortable, see you in pain (literally crying about this), see you anxious, and then not want to do anything about it. You bf should WANT to make you feel better and WANT to reassure you. And if he isn't, that's a real disrespect in my view.

From what you put here, I feel like your boyfriend is being kind of intentionally obtuse. He doesn't want to see how cold she treats you because it makes things more difficult for him and it means he can't pretend anymore that her attitude isn't platonic. And that he's implicated in enabling her to flirt and give him sexual attention. It sounds like he's enjoying the sexualized attention from someone else that's not you and that bothers me.

I'm not saying he needs to cut all ties with this person. But I do think he owes you an honest conversation about how much he cares about your feelings and what he can do to make you feel comfortable. Is there a collaborative solution or at least compromise you can both feel good about? Like he doesn't spend any time with this person one or one or doesn't text this person?

"Pregnancy absolutely destroys a woman’s body, beyond the superficial. When a woman is pregnant, her heart enlarges and moves to the side to make room for the baby. Her entire body changes.  When women give birth, their vulva lips tear or are cut open. Imagine walking around with tears in your scrotum. It is not only the pain of labor itself. My mother urinates herself when she yells, decades after she was last pregnant. She lost bladder control after the hardships of pregnancy and giving birth. You think it’s superficial, but you are not taking on the risks. Talk to the other women in your life who have given birth. Ask them for the reality of pregnancy: what changed during it and what never changed back. Ask them to be graphic, because women are used to editing themselves. Childbirth is upheld as an ideal and its downsides is often downplayed.

I'm a 21 y o. student, and my libido is very high, however I have never had a boyfriend or did more than hold hands with someone. 

I really need someone I can have an intimate physical relation with, but I fear I will get attached. I have ADHD, and with it RSD, which makes it all the harder not to get hurt thinking I'm replacable and feeling special to someone is a big wish of mine. 

I can't read most guys at all, but some did try to sleep with me but left it when I told them I was a virgin, probably because they also thought I might want to do that with someone special.

Firstly, I have no idea where to find someone whom I can be attracted to romantically and physically, it happens rarely. It's either one, but I absolutely can't stand being touched by someone I do not feel physically attracted to. 
At the same time I fear I won't be able to emotionally let go of someone I solely find physically attractive once we get intimate. 

Should I really just build up a ""whatever"" attitude and go on tinder/ give guys the chance to sleep with me? Will my first time feel wasted?

"I’m surprised no one else is saying this: he’s abusive. He is abusing you. 

>I know he gaslights and manipulates. Its the type of environment he grew up in. Mom was a junkie, step-dad was a hells angel. I know him,and his ways, so for the most part, I know how to work with them.

Growing up in that environment does not give him a pass to act like this as an adult. He is perpetrating the cycle of violence. 

>The messed up part is that he treats me like gold. He tells me he doesn't feel like he's good enough for me. Is super attentive, encourages my art. He's an amazing dad. Our daughter is 13 and she idolize's him. To meet him, he's charming, charismatic, and handsome. Unless I'm acting ""out of line"", he treats me better than anyone I've ever had in my life.

His treating you great sometimes does not negate his treating you poorly sometimes. Something rarely mentioned in popular media is that abusive relationships can be loving and have wonderful moments. Those moments are why ending an abusive relationship can be difficult. The problem is the other unpredictable moments when they arbitrarily decide you’re “out of line”. You are who you are. It’s worrisome that he doesn’t like you as you are and he gets angry when you don’t fit an idea in his head. 

It’s fine that you have a 1950s household when it is what you always wanted. However, did you want to always defer to the man? Do you want to never have an opinion or a voice? Is this what you want? I don’t think it’s what you want. If you wanted this, you wouldn’t be upset and asking for an outside opinion. I’m glad you’re asking for an outside perspective. 

I don’t have any advice other than to take a deep look at your life. Is this what you want to model for your daughter? That as long as a man is good to you in one area, it’s ok for him to tell you that you’re not good enough? That as long as he encourages you in one area, it’s ok that you can’t defend yourself? That because someone grew up in an adverse household, it is ok for them to gaslight you? Do you want her to learn that she should never speak up or voice an opinion?

I advise looking at the types of abuse on National Domestic Violence Hotline and calling them for advice.

"I don’t do anything special for my appointments. I don’t shave in my everyday life, so I don’t shave for the gyno. I shower at night in my everyday life so I don’t take a special shower before going to the gynecologist. I run around my normal routine, and then I go to the doctors. 

If you have good hygiene in general, you don’t need to do anything special. When I say good hygiene, I mean you shower daily and you don’t have body odor so bad that your next door neighbor can smell it through their walls. 

Keep in mind, if they are an obstetrician/gynecologist, they deliver babies which means they’ve seen people poop themselves. It is normal for people to poop when they deliver babies. So you showing up within 24 hours after a shower is not a big deal.

Never douche or use scented products to mask your “smell.” First, a healthy vagina smells fine. Our vaginas should not smell like roses and that’s natural. Second, if there is an issue, you don’t want to cover up the smell because it could help a physician know that there is an issue. Third, douches are more likely to give you a yeast infection than do anything helpful. It creates problems where there are no problems. 

If you don’t usually shave, don’t shave. Gynos have seen countless vulvas. Some are shaved, some are hairy. Some are healthy and some have infections. The doctor had seen everything. Your vulva is fine the way it is. If it’s not fine (such as a yeast infection or BV), then they can diagnose and treat it.

My only advice is wear knee-length wool socks so you’re warmer while you wearing nothing but a paper gown. But that’s just a bonus tip.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/q2sbr6/i_had_never_been_to_the_gynecologist_before_how/hfnmkme/,ConsentfulCuddles,female
"Throw it out when you throw out the rest of the trash. 

The trash remains open. If your trash can has a lid, then it stays shut. I do not do anything with the trash. When you visit people’s home, do you tie up the trash bag or take out the trash on the way out? Same thing with bathroom trash. I properly wrap my pad (unfortunately not everyone does), throw it in the trash can, and walk away. 

Since you don’t want to waste the bag, you can do what I do: when it’s time to take out the kitchen trash, dump the small bathroom trash into the larger kitchen trash bag so you can reuse the bathroom bag. As long as nothing wet touches the bag, I reuse it. Some people will find this gross so I don’t admit doing this to people. (Also, trash habits is not a normal topic of conversation.) For example, if someone threw their used tampon into the bag without wrapping it, I would throw away the bag. If the tampon was properly wrapped and none of the blood got onto the bag, I reuse the bag.  

Smells: I disagree with people saying there is never a smell. There can be smells. Usually, there is no smell but some people smell more than others. I was able to smell when a certain coworker used the bathroom; it grossed me out. I have had periods that smelled horrible too when I had BV or another infection.

"Time and being kind to yourself. 

Seriously, it just takes time. Allow yourself to feel sad and keep living life. Stop judging yourself as weak, or stupid. Calling yourself mean names is not stopping you from being sad or missing him. Being mean is not useful so stop doing that. Be kind to yourself. 

It makes sense that you feel sad when you formed a deep emotional connection with someone and then they disappear when they find someone new. 

It took me two years to get over a short-term casual sex partner. We didn’t have a deep emotional connection and he was always clear that he didn’t see me as a real relationship prospect, and yet I still missed him. Don’t wallow in your feelings, but it’s ok to feel sad or miss him.

Being sad is not being dramatic. Dramatic is in the actions you could take such as if you sent him a teary video yelling at him for betraying your grand love and exhorting him to break up with her to be with you. Dramatic would be telling everyone how he was a cruel vain man. You’re not being dramatic. You’re having a reasonable reaction to the end of a meaningful relationship.

"When you talked, did you two discuss what you hoped to get out of the relationship? Did you two agree it would be a relationship of convenience or of serious potential to meet up and be a long-term relationship?

Advice for the future:
- always discuss what a relationship is so you can set expectations for yourself. If you are ready to have sex or sext, you need that conversation. It doesn’t need to be in depth. It can be causal “so, we’re casual, just for fun?” Then occasionally you should assess whether the relationship is supporting what you want. If you find that your feelings or expectations change, then discuss them with the other person. 
- if you agree it would be a relationship of convenience and you find yourself taking it more seriously, discuss with them. If their feelings have deepened too, then you can decide if you want to become more serious. If they intend to keep it not serious, disengage before you get more emotionally involved. That is what happened in my situation. When I realized my feelings were much stronger than appropriate for a relationship of convenience and not reciprocated, I ended the relationship to not hurt myself more. 
- if it was agreed that there was potential to be a serious, long-term relationship, then it’s completely logical you are so sad. Heartbreak is a risk in every relationship.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/q30h93/during_lockdown_i_built_a_deep_emotional/hfp5qjb/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

"First, put the responsibility where it belongs. You’re not the one getting him into trouble. He is getting himself into trouble. He is harassing you. 

Second, tell him directly “I prefer to keep my personal and professional life separately. I do not date coworkers. Do not ask me out again. It is inappropriate.” You have to do this step. If you don’t explicitly state the boundary, he can claim ignorance or he’s being “friendly.” Once you make it explicitly clear you only want a professional relationship, then he cannot make excuses. 

Do not be nice. Do not say “you’re a friendly guy.” Do not appease him. He will take any crumb of being polite as a sign of interest. Do not be subtle. Do not say “not today” or “I’m busy”. You have to be explicit that it’s never. Note, it may give you a reputation of being unfriendly, but it’s better than dealing with his continual sexual harassment. 

Think of it this way: he is not being nice to you. He is putting you in a uncomfortable position. He is being unprofessional. You don’t owe him niceness. You owe no one niceness. 

Third, start documenting every interaction. Put down the date, time, location, what he said, and what you said. Take screenshots of everything. If you have screenshots of his prior communications, log them too. The stuff that is directly said or done to you has greater weight. If he does not deescalate, report him to HR. 

I will note that it may not do anything but it is better to try and report him, than to not try and wonder what if you had reported him. Disclaimer: I do not work in HR nor have to deal with workplace harassment.

"To gain an understanding of her experience without making her relive it, read Chanel Miller’s memoir “Know My Name”. She was the Emily Doe in the Stanford swimmer rape case. 

It is one experience and every one is different. I recommend it because I learned what not to do from reading that book:

- don’t make it about you. Don’t talk about how angry it makes you, or how you would beat that guy up, or how you would never do that. It’s making her have to comfort you, or deal with your anger/emotions. 
- don’t have expectations of how she should act. Don’t expect her to be more traumatized. Don’t expect her to be less traumatized. 
- She may get fits of rage. She may have fits of tears. She is a different person now, but don’t treat her differently. Don’t make her into a victim. 
- don’t be surprised when she acts ok. It could be an act because she’s tired of pity. Or it could be she is fine in this moment. 

There is no easy answer. I think of it as just bearing witness to their pain, anger, and sadness. Give her a space to be however she feels. Though that’s complicated by if she acts ok for your benefit. But you can’t ask her if her behavior is a facade because that may be asking her to act more like a “victim”. All you can do is be present and say “I’m here for whatever you need. If you want to talk about it, or if you want to talk about other things. I understand the world looks different now but I’m still here.” 

The only moments in the memoir when Chanel had, I can’t say positive experience, but the only times she wasn’t burdened by what other people expected from her was when she was with other women who had been assaulted who said “that sucks” and were just present with her. 

Other things I do when I go on these Reddit posts (and there are so many; sadly it’s so common):
- don’t agree when she downplays what happened. If she makes jokes, don’t laugh but don’t be appalled. Don’t lecture her for making a joke because that’s a coping mechanism. But don’t laugh because then she’ll think you don’t take it seriously. “I’m still sorry it happened to you and it sucked. But yeah, <semi agree while being clear you take it seriously>.” It’s a balance between keeping the mood she set and not brushing off what happened. 
- if she says “oh it’s my fault. I did this”, always place blame where it belongs: on the perpetrator. “If that person had not assaulted you, you would not be assaulted. It’s not your fault.” It’s the truth. The perpetrator chose to assault someone and they are the ones who did the action.

Some people truly are as resilient as they seem after an attack. Some are ok after an assault and the effects are seen years later. Some are not ok after an attack and it shows. Every one is different and all you can do is bear witness to her.",/r/askwomenadvice/comments/q209t9/how_can_i_m24_best_support_my_girlfriend_f22_who/hfshowc/,ConsentfulCuddles,female

Content warning of a mugging; how freezing can be helpful:

I got mugged by two people, one person in front of me and one person behind me. When the police took my report, recounting it made me realize it had been only one person. He had approached me from the front and yelled behind me to “grab her phone!”  I froze and stared at him, which probably saved me from getting punched out.

"Your boyfriend is clear that your options are take it or leave it. He is telling you that this is who he is and he is not willing to have a conversation about it. He is 42, he won’t change, and you can’t change someone, especially someone who doesn’t want to change. Date the person you are with, not the person you wish they were. If you wish he was someone else, break up and date someone who is more reliable. 

This happened in my first relationship and we were in our 20s. By our 40s, we are more set in our ways. I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend over a comic convention. We had planned months in advance and then he didn’t go with me. He had his valid reasons so it felt petty of me, but it was my breaking point. It’s the small things that make up a relationship. I tired of not being able to rely on him to fulfill plans. I want someone to be present and spend time with me. I am understanding of people being busy and not having time to meet up. I am fine with people disappearing for months when they get busy, but I’m not fine with people making plans and never keeping them.

"Dry skin: it sounds odd but apply lotion onto wet skin. When I get out of a shower, I apply Cetaphil cream onto my wet skin. If you live in a dry environment and there is no water on your skin, it’ll pull water out of your skin. When there is water on your skin, then it will pull water into your skin. It needs water to work. This is the humectants someone else mentioned. My source is Dr Dray on YouTube. Plus I got rid of dry patches this way. 

Creams are thicker and better for dry skin. Lotions are too thin for my skin. I also advise against using scents. Stuff like orange oils can actually be drying. (Think about when you peel an orange.

"Here’s my answer to your question:

It is unfair that he is putting you in limbo. If he loves you so much, he can break up with her. It would be much kinder to her if he broke up with her now, before she gets more emotionally invested, and because he is still hung up on his ex. Instead, he is putting you both in limbo. The difference is you know you’re in limbo and she doesn’t. He is deciding who he likes more by waiting. You know you’re waiting for him to break up. She doesn’t know he’s thinking about his ex. He’s making you a backup plan. Don’t wait for him. He acts as though he’s honoring his commitment to her but he’s not. She doesn’t know about you. 

Even if he gets back with you, he will do the same thing to you. He will date you and then tell other girls that he loves them, but he promised to be with you. It’s not commitment when someone else is on your mind. Your other posts say he cheated on you. Do you understand that he’s cheating on her with you now? He probably used these exact lines on the girls he cheated with before. 

You’re broken up. Move on. There will be other people but you do need to work on yourself more.

I grew up in a dysfunctional home, and there were many things my first boyfriend did not understand and could not hold space for me.

"Other people are asking you the same thing he is asking you: “what is he supposed to say to or do for you?” He needs direction. 

We often get posts in which someone asks how do they comfort someone else. The answer is almost always: ask that person. So he is doing what many of us would tell him: ask the person. Everyone is comforted differently. If you want to be comforted in a certain way, you have to articulate it to him. What he may find comforting, may not be comforting to you. For example, when I am upset, I need people to leave me alone so I don’t feel stupid by being emotional in front of them. Whereas, other people need people to be with them or they will feel neglected. Only you can tell him what you need. You’re asking us to figure out how to make him give you what you need, but we don’t know what you need anymore than he does. 

We’re all different people.

> I would like him to show more emotion (he used to become upset if I was upset)

But he hasn’t lost someone like the way you lost someone. He is removed and at a distance. You’re the one in the midst of the grief. I want to hold you with gentleness and care, but I’m a plain spoken person. 

When my friends are sad, I don’t cry with them because I don’t work that way. I have a clear boundary between my feelings and other people’s feelings. I am a less emotional person so I would be confused if someone ask me “get upset with me.” It’s your loss and I feel bad for you, but I don’t actually feel that loss. Instead, I try to be there for them to talk to. Is he listening to you when you talk? Does he stay or does he wander off in irritation?

Separately, you may want to find a grief support group. Grieving requires a community. Often, the only people can who truly understand grief are those who have experienced the same depth of loss. You suffered a large loss. It is unfair to expect him to feel the loss when it wasn’t his loss.

One tactic used by people with intent to harm is to point out how they’re not something when they are something. In the opening story, a man offers to help a woman with her groceries.

Either we merge our finances into one joint account and pay everything from there going forward or we don't move in together, simple as that. Some years later, she is happy I forced her to merge with me.

"Options are 

- accept his messes and live with it
- hire a housekeeper to clean the house weekly so it’s not a source of tension
- pick one day of the week to clean together
- passive aggressive method: don’t clean up after him but do gather all his messes into one spot so it’s out of your way. 
- don’t accept his messes and continue to bring it up with him, which will lead to fights
- don’t accept his messes and move out. Note that I didn’t say to break up. Some couples live separately and it works better for them. Although expected, there is no rule that says couples must live together. 

I have lived with messy roommates. What I have noticed with messy people is the mess doesn’t bother them. One roommate spilled a bag of sugar in the kitchen and she didn’t clean it up. It’s just a different perspective. She never got better. When we wanted her to clean something, we had to supervise her.

Everyone has different tolerances of cleanliness. I, myself, have been the messy roommate. I’m cleaner than some people and less clean than others.

Everything else, I see it as a personal preference: making the bed, unloading a clean dishwasher, picking clothes and blankets off the floor. While I agree with you and would want the bed made, the dishwasher unloaded, and the floor clear, I can see why he wouldn’t do those things. None of those things would draw pests or affect functionality so it’s not a concern. He likely thinks of home as a place to relax, and not a place to organize.

"I wasn’t taught either. I just picked it up along the way. 

Skin care: I have acne and my routine was given to me by a dermatologist. The basic is wash your face with facial soap, moisturize, and use sunscreen. Wash and moisturize at night too. Be aware that the purpose of skincare companies is to sell you products so they make more profit. Keep it simple. You don’t need hundreds of serums and acids. In fact, you can damage your skin if you use too many products. 

Hair care: it’s trial and error. Biggest thing is that shampoo and conditioner are two separate products. Finding a stylist who knows how to cut your hair is important too. I have thick coarse hair and with the wrong stylist, my hair is unflattering. My friends with curly hair had to find a good stylist and learn how to manage their hair over years. 

Clothes: again, trial and error. It took years to find a style that felt like me. I used to have long hair and wearing dresses felt like a costume, even though I’m a cis woman. When I chopped off all my hair, dresses felt more natural. 

Makeup: I learned from magazines and makeup packages. I rarely wear makeup. At most, I use eyeliner and lipstick. I grew up before makeup video tutorials and to be honest, makeup that kids can do these days is beyond me. It’s a lot of practicing at home where no one can see you (in general, not you specifically).

"Professional settings: I would say a handshake. If you’re concerned about the strength, I would say you can reduce it by 25-50%. Go softer. Though really, if someone gives me a firm handshake, I assume they’re a weightlifter (I’m into lifting so that’s a positive thing). 

Handshake: In my area, handshakes aren’t gendered but I have met a few women in which their handshake is gendered. They give the ladylike handshake (I don’t know the term) where they slip their hand into mine as though we are in a Regency movie and I feel as though I should lift it up to my lips to kiss. I don’t kiss; I just let their hand slip into mine and then the handshake ends. You can take note of how women around you shake hands and adjust accordingly. 

Personal settings: it depends on the woman. I would prefer just a wave or a handshake with a smile when meeting new people. I love hugs but I dislike hugs from new people. My least favorite is when someone opens their arms and then says “I am a hug person. Can I hug you?” It’s not really an ask when they are halfway into a hug. 

It also depends on culture. For example, I’m in the US and Europeans think we’re idiots because of how much we smile. At the same time, US is less tactile than some other countries. Even within the US, greetings vary between East Coast, West Coast, Midwest, South etc. So it depends on where you are. My advice is observe how other women around you do it and copy.

"She has been given support and resources. It’s up to her on how she uses it. It’s kind that you’re paying forward good deeds that were done for you. However, you need to figure out a timeline and boundaries.

The cynical side of me wants to say you’re being a sucker and essentially her sugar daddy. She doesn’t need to take care of herself because men like you will swoop in and take care of her. She moved across the country to follow one man. She moved back across because another man will willing to take her in. However, the fact you’ve been in her shoes and you’ve been uplifted by others makes me think you’re being altruistic. 

It does not matter how good her reasons are, you need to have your own boundaries. It does not matter whether she intends to use you, the reality is that she is using you. She can try to make more out of her life, or she can keep getting a free ride (literal and figuratively) from you. You need to give her boundaries and a timeline. We all need a helping hand but there is a limit. You need to tell her what you expect of her and when. If she doesn’t like it, she can move out. You’re not obligated to keep her in your house. You don’t have a roommate situation here. You have a parent-child relationship; you’re paying for everything and she feels entitled to it. You may not be her mother but you’re playing that role.

"Your options are:

- let things continue as they have been and accept that you may never see her arrive at the place you’re at now. You can continue to give her support and she continues to take it for granted. It’s fine if you choose this. It’s your life, money, and house. You can do with them as you like, but you need to accept that she may not grow up or meet whatever milestones you have in your head for her. You won’t see an immediate reward (ie her being grateful, taking control of her life, or acknowledging how much you’re giving her) and you may not see it for years. Just as it took you years to see what people gave you, it will take her years, if she ever does see it. 

- cut things off. Save your money, time, and energy. I present this option because it sounds like you need a reminder that this is an option.  It is an option. I grew up with a parent with a gambling addiction. So I always advise people against pouring their life energy into saving someone else. A person can only give what they can before they deplete themselves. Only you know how much you have to give someone until you’re depleted. 

- middle ground is to give her a timeline and boundaries.

If you want to help people, you could give money or time to organizations. You can try doing it on an individual level like you have done here.

What are your fears specifically regarding making an appointment? Are you afraid of the potential diagnosis itself? Afraid of not being taken seriously? If you do have adhd and get an official diagnosis, you will then have access to tools that will improve your quality of life and interpersonal relationships. If you do not get a diagnosis (and disagree with that), you can seek a second opinion. If you do not get a diagnosis and give up pursuing one, you can still look into coping mechanisms and strategies that adhd people use to get by.

If you are afraid of not being taken seriously, the only thing you can do is try and if the doctor doesn't listen to you, you can go to another one. It isn't all or nothing on this one person and one appointment.

I am in the process of getting an adhd diagnosis myself. I spoke to my therapist about it who agreed it was worth checking with a psychiatrist about. My psychiatrist agreed that it sounds like I could have adhd, and gave me a prescription for non-stimulant medication (Strattera) which is helping in the meantime while I wait for my appointment for neuropsychological testing, after which he may prescribe for me a stimulant adhd med like Adderall.

Don’t share personal stories, don’t exchange personal information.

Ignore inappropriate behavior. Don’t acknowledge it.

Unfortunately you need to show that you let him know where the boundaries are. Otherwise it’s a big “I didn’t know.

>I always pictured therapy to be an emotionally stimulating and cathartic experience but I came out feeling so distraught that my coping mechanism (maladaptive daydreaming) was more active post that. I've heard that therapy isn't easy and it's not gonna immediately make you happy.

On the other hand, you need to set realistic expectations for therapy. I will attest that therapy does not make you happy. I spent many sessions bawling my eyes out and walking out crying. I am someone who does not cry often in my everyday life, so therapy was definitely distressing. Therapy makes you dig into yourself and confront issues that you may have repressed in order to make it through the day by day. That is not an easy, simulating or cathartic process. It can be slow, draining, and painful.

In my first round of therapy as an adult, I honestly finished the sessions pissed that I wasn’t cured. I was still depressed. However, going to therapy gave me a foundation. It familiarized me to therapy and helped me know that I can reach out for help. Going to individual therapy gave me access to other resources such as group therapy, which helped me feel less alone and gave me strength to do other things. Therapy may not always seem to have an immediate payout, but it can be a stepping stone. I often could not see the effects of therapy until years later when I drew on what we talked about in therapy.  You should not expect therapy to make you better immediately. It gets worse before it gets better. 

All that said, I have liked my therapists on an individual level. When I didn’t, I asked for a different person. The first therapist I saw was brusque and I didn’t like it.

"You can’t. 

You cannot “help her see the brighter side of life”. 

I have no advice but I can share my perspective as someone who had depression. It feels horrible to be told “Look at the bright side” when clinically depressed. When we have depression, we cannot look at the bright side. Our brain cannot process good emotions or form good memories. Being told to look at the bright side only highlights our inability to do so. We literally cannot look at the bright side. If I could, I would have. If it were so simple, I would have.

What helped was someone keeping space for me and making me not feel alone in my depression. I found those spaces at group therapy and individual therapy. I have no advice other than just be there and let them be sad. What sufficed for me may be irrelevant here as I was a low suicide risk. 

Separately, holding space for a suicidal person is a heavy load and it’s not one I would pick up for anyone else.  I sought out professional help because the level of help I needed was beyond what a friend can provide. Everyone is different and different levels of depression will need different treatment. 

The main remedy for depression is time. Medication could help speed the timeline towards management, but suicide risk makes it dangerous. Depression isn’t something that’s cured overnight; it cannot be overcome by thinking positively. My mantra was “maybe tomorrow, I’ll feel better.” But I had to say it, and I had to wish it, and I had to hope for it until it came true. No one could have said anything that broke through my depression.

"That's the scary part, once your heart's not in it, it's  difficult to convince yourself otherwise. Look up ""relationship indifference"".

\- Resentful/anxiety-ridden whenever they were around. Hugh wave of relief when they weren't. 

\- Angry at the slightest and tiniest of things they did. Any and everything set me off

\- CONSTANTLY convincing/questioning myself why I was in the relationship still, and having to reassure myself of their positive traits. 

\- Not wanting their touch, or feeling completely numb if they did touch me. 

&#x200B;

You were angry, you were sad, you were everything on the emotional scale and he didn't change, so now you're drained, and numb. I would recommend counselling if you really do want this relationship to work, but before you spend money, time, and resources on it, you should genuinely ask if you WANT to make this work.

"Whether or not he is a sociopath (and I'm not qualified to make that judgement but he certainly sounds like one to me) is irrelevant.  The fact of the matter is that he does not care when you're in physical or emotional pain and has also shown that he's fine with **causing** you physical and emotional pain, as evidenced by the forehead flicking comment you made and his insulting you as a ""joke"". (Remember, jokes are only jokes if everyone laughs at the end).  As another commenter pointed out, not caring if you're hurt and not caring if he hurts you has a very clear implication, which is escalating abuse.

Now even if he wasn't being physically abusive, and it was just the regular insults and lack of caring if you're hurt, that would be more than enough reason to leave.  Even if he *didn't* insult you and just didn't care when you were hurt, *that* would be enough reason to leave him.  **You shouldn't have to teach him how to care about you.**  His lack of ability to form an emotional connection is not your problem, but it absolutely will be a problem **for** you if you stay with him.

"My boyfriend has diagnosed ADHD and OCD, and everyone (his psychiatrist included) suspects he is autistic, he just hasn’t pursued a diagnosis. And let me tell you - he does some weird shit. Sometimes 5-10 seconds will pass between me saying something and him responding.

Sometimes he says things that *do* hurt without meaning to, and we have to have a conversation. Sometimes I get anxious (I’m also overly empathetic with anxiety) because his tone of voice is not an indicator of his feelings like it would be for a neurotypical person. His ADHD inattention and OCD compulsions have caused lateness, missed activities, aborted date nights, and other mild inconveniences. There’s been a lot to work through as he unlearns his masking.

You know what he’s NEVER done? Hurt me on purpose or failed to respond when I was in pain. That *does* sound sociopathic. And genuinely, being a sociopath doesn’t make you a bad person.

"Wow there’s….like a lot going on here. First of all, she’s probably feeling a little insecure about her abilities in the bedroom. I don’t think she understands that *time* does not equal **high quality sex** nor does the amount of partners. And tbh I’m not sure you do either. Good sex requires being open to your partners desires and needs, enthusiasm, communication, and intimacy. I can bet that sex while drunk and high on cocaine wasn’t really that great. Second, wtf does the amount of hookups she have to do with anything? This isn’t a numbers game here my guy. Also, she’s wanting to have a threesome? And you’re not down for that? I’m genuinely surprised given the content of both of your sexual history. Is it a jealousy issue? Because it seems like some of her insecurities could stem from major miscommunication issues about sex in general between the both of you. Why don’t you both just sit down and have a really honest conversation about sex? Talk about *your* insecurities and hers, talk about preferences, what you like and don’t like. Talk about your definitions of what makes a sexual experience amazing for you.

"Okay that’s problematic-ish. I can understand a bit of jealousy from time to time, but that’s like….really possessive. Just because y’all are dating, doesn’t mean she *belongs* to you. It just means you’re dating. Typically jealousy is a sign of mistrust and insecurity, and comes from fear. The fear that you are not a good enough partner and lover. I think you may want to talk to a therapist and her about these insecurities and issues. Because that’s not healthy, and only makes her feel bad. She probably feels like you don’t trust her enough to choose you over anyone else. That you don’t feel secure enough in her feelings for you.

"She is disrespecting you and the boundaries you've set. Some (including me) would argue that what she is doing is cheating. You've talked about it before, and she's doing it again. She is obviously hiding it from you - meaning she knows she is doing something you wouldn't like. 

I usually don't recommend this straight (no pun intended) away, but I think you should dump her. I really don't think there's anything wrong with you or like you've done something wrong. It's all on her. If you did something, (which I doubt) or she has a problem with you being non-binary, a mature and caring person would have had a conversation about it, and break up if that's needed. It would hurt, but it would've bern for the best for the both of you. But no, instead of that, she decides to basically cheat on you and lie to you. I can think of dozens of ways that she could've acted which would've been better than this.

She broke your trust. Twice. And trust is essential for a healthy relationship. I think she ruined every chance of it working out.

In this case, I think it would be helpful for you to own up to your own mistakes and assumptions - but if he doesn't see the need to do the same, it doesn't need to be your job to walk him through where and why there's a problem.

As for B, it's not on her to try and fix the inequity in how Dad treats her versus R - and again, you can own your part in not handling this as well as you could have with her, too.  But she's old enough to be aware that taking too much advantage of Dad's favoritism or going out of her way to exclude R will damage her relationship with R over time.

"Girl had severe panic attack as we were about to have sex. Now she won’t talk to me…
I’m 25M and she is 20F.

TL;DR: Girl I’m seeing was raped 3 years ago. We were about to have sex but she broke down and had a severe panic attack. We stopped immediately, I comforted her, but now she is very distant. I don’t know what to do and would like advice.

I’ve been seeing this girl only for about 3 weeks or so. We’ve talked a ton via Snapchat, FaceTime, have hung out multiple times in person lasting 5+ hours, and overall got really close really fast. We basically have talked every day for most of the day. We are not exclusive, and have not had that talk yet.

One detail I need to mention, is that she opened up to me about that when she was 17, she was raped. I thanked her for sharing that and trusting me enough to be vulnerable around me. She told me this pretty much at the start. We hadn’t done anything sexual up until what I’m about to tell you.

Last Monday, about 3-4 days ago, she came over my house. Things started getting heated after a little while, so we decided to go up to my room. Keep in mind it was her that initiated a lot of it, I was just matching her energy. She was on top of me and we were making out for a bit. After a bit more of that, I got her off with my fingers and she was super into it. We were about to have sex but I forgot to bring the condoms upstairs, so I excused myself really quickly to get them. I came back, put the condom on, turned around back to her and saw that she wasn’t ok. She started immediately apologizing, I told her not to worry, took the condom off, and got back into bed. I asked her if I could hold her and she said yes. So I held her close and rubbed her back until she felt better.

Afterwards she started apologizing again and I told her it was all perfectly fine and I understand. I also said that I never expect sex or anything to happen when we hang out, she responded by saying she knew and thanked me. She followed up by saying that this is something people who are with her have to be aware of, I said that I completely understand and have zero issues with it at all. Even without her past, if someone wanted to take it slow when it came to sexual stuff, that’s always fine by me.

She stayed for another 1-2 hours and things were completely normal. I walked her out to her car, we hugged for a few minutes, kissed, and then she said she’d call me once home. However, she never called. So a few hours after she left, I texted her saying I had a great time. She said that she did too and apologized for not texting once home. I told her it was all good and said goodnight since it was late and I was going to bed.

Since then, things haven’t been the same. We barely talk compared to what we used to. It all just feels so off, like things went from 100-0. She’ll open my snaps and not reply like she used to. She’ll take a long time in between replies. I know it sounds petty, but when you get into a bit of a routine with someone and it changes a lot, you tend to notice considering we’d snap and FaceTime every day on the days we weren’t meeting up.

I’ve been just chilling playing it cool. Like I haven’t been snapping/texting as much because it seems like she doesn’t want to talk, so I’ve just been respecting her space and acting normal when we do have interactions. But I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t so tempting to reach out and ask her if things are ok with her and between us.

The only thing this all hinges off of, is the the panic attack right before sex. The second she left my house is when the contact started to drastically decrease. I’m not sure what to do or think. I’ve tried analyzing the situation and telling it to others in grave detail to see if I did something wrong, but I genuinely can’t pinpoint anything. I could really use some outside opinions, I like this girl a lot and we got close pretty damn fast.

Edit: Forgot to mention that she is in therapy and has been for years now regarding everything that has happened. She was also transparent about that",/r/relationship_advice/comments/qnefy8/girl_had_severe_panic_attack_as_we_were_about_to/,tbets,male
"Thank you for your response. Yes, she has had therapy and has had sexual experiences since what happened. The way she described it all last she was here, is that she takes awhile to be ready and she thought she was because she wanted it.

I could tell this was a really embarrassing experience for her, but I did let her know after it happened that I’m here for her and think no differently about her whatsoever",/r/relationship_advice/comments/qnefy8/girl_had_severe_panic_attack_as_we_were_about_to/hjfmezy/,tbets,male
"I definitely do want a relationship with this girl and for her to be my girlfriend at the end of the day. As far as her experience goes with sex and relationships, we’re pretty even. I think she’s been with 2 or 3 people and had 2 relationships.

It’s weird because when we do interact, it’s normal. It’s very limited since the incident, but the frequency has decreased a ton. I almost don’t even want to bring it up again, but I think I may reiterate that I’m here for her if this weirdness persists and doesn’t seem to be getting better. We usually hang out on Mondays and Wednesdays, so I guess we shall see if he still wants to hang. I’m tempted to see if maybe instead of her coming here to my place, we go to hers so the environment is more comfortable is that makes sense? She doesn’t like going out much, so out dates have been mainly at my house just talking, watching stuff, cuddling, making out, etc.",/r/relationship_advice/comments/qnefy8/girl_had_severe_panic_attack_as_we_were_about_to/hjfoov7/,tbets,male

I know I’m incapable of “fixing” her and at the end of the day, it’s on her. But to completely turn my back on this person so soon? It just doesn’t feel right atm.

"My (26) GF (29) ""broke up"" with me after throwing a tantrum because I'm going to a wedding without her.
I use quotations for ""broke up"" because she has broken up with me, or said she wanted to brake up in the past, only to come back the day after. This has happened a few times in our almost 3 year relationship. I know to many people this is an instant red flag, but anyway... 

It's always been difficult for me to invite her to social gatherings because she's very jealous and pretty much anything can trigger her. Every time an event comes up, I feel hesitant to invite her or even tell her about it because she might get upset over something. She says she doesn't want to go, but then gets upset because I go without her, she goes and then gets upset because she thinks I'm flirting with somebody at the party even if she's there, etc. This time she was mad because I told her only one day before the party, I invited her and she said no and said I was telling her on such short notice because secretly I didn't want her to go, so she thinks it was all a scheme. TBH that is partially true, I wouldn't mind taking her, but I know she might start some trouble for any given reason if she goes so I'm more comfortable just going alone. 

She was mad for days and then when we finally saw each other again, I had to tell her I have to go to a wedding this week. She gets super mad obviously, says I am hiding her from my friends and denying we're in a relationship. I told her I couldn't take her with me because the bride and groom specifically told me I couldn't bring a plus one because they had a limited budget and couldn't have too many people, they also apologized. To me that is perfectly understandable, weddings are expensive and you can't invite everyone, I'm not even THAT close to them.

She doesn't think that's reasonable. Actually, she is very offended by this and says I shouldn't go without her, out of respect for her. 

I realise the best thing would be taking her to the wedding, it would be ideal, I wish I could. But really, everytime I take part in social activities that do not involve her, there's a big chance she will get mad. This is nothing new.

Last night, I tried texting her to see if we could see if we could meet in person to talk and make things right. She said no twice and told me to stop talking to her, so I did. A few hours later, she texts me back super angry saying I have ""no initiative"" because I didn't try harder to convince her, I didn't fight for our relationship, or something. This really made me mad and I told her she needed to stop acting like everything's my fault and we should solve our problems as grown-ups.

Perhaps the worst part is that she also goes to a lot of meetings and parties without me, she even refuses to tell me about them sometimes. She blocked me from all social media because she got jealous everytime somebody liked my photos or whatever and has refused to add me again several times. This is why this tantrum seems so stupid and immature to me.

Our relantionship has been very nice in many other aspects. We've had a lot of fun together, her family is extremely nice to me, spending time together was great, she has been very supportive in general. BUT, we've had this jealousy problem every now and then. 

I don't feel so easy and confident just breaking up after three years. I'm not sure if she's gonna try to get back together or if it's for real this time, I don't know if I should try to get her back or even reject her if SHE comes to me after a few days. I do love her very much, but this is kinda ridiculous. TBH I'm not even too sad about her being mad and breaking up with me.  


TL;DR  


\- GF gets very jealous frequently when I have other social activities.  
\- Last week she got mad because I didn't invite her to a party soon enough and thinks I did it on purpose so she wouldn't go.  
\- This week I have to go to a wedding to which she is not invited, I can't take a plus one.

\- She broke up with me then threw a fit over text when I tried talking to her to work things out. She blames all of our problems on me.

\- Don't know if I should try to get back with her, or even reject her if she wants to get back.",/r/relationship_advice/comments/qnpdxo/my_26_gf_29_broke_up_with_me_after_throwing_a/,QuellFred,male

I'm pretty skeptical about wellness and all that stuff, I think a lot of people use it because they're afraid to go to therapy, which is sometimes uncomfortable and difficult, while meditation and wellness and all that is usually positive and ""feel-good"".

"My relationship with my closest friend is confusing and I don't know what to do
Warning: this is a fuckin novel. Side note: I'm using a throwaway, you'll see why soon enough.

I (24M) have known my closest friend (23F) since 2nd grade. We went to school together from that time through highschool, her just a grade below me. We were fairly close through that entire time, I always had an on and off thing with her friend who was literally inseparable from her until they had a falling out around her junior year of highschool. This set the tone for our relationship dynamic early on, yet I always had an attraction to her and she did for me for quite a while as well. It just never felt appropriate to act on this for us. Also around her junior year she ended up dating a friend of mine, this lasted for about 2 years. During this time I began to notice my feelings for her more as I spent more time around her, but I went back to burying my feelings. She was with a very close friend of mine, once again, she's off limits.

The three of us started to develop a bit of a drug addiction. Oxys. We'd been flirting with a slow dependence on these pills for a while but it really began to take hold a year or so into their relationship. Their relationship was already kind of crumbling, and the added stress of drug addiction was pushing it to its limits. When I would hang out with them it became a regular occurrence that they would fight and she would leave and go cry in her car or something like that. Frequently I felt bad for her and I'd go talk to her and calm her down. They both were becoming toxic for one another, but he was becoming especially snappy. Eventually he had to move into a different apartment, and it was kind of hastily done so his temporary place was a shit hole. She didn't love being there so she spent more time living with her parents than she did there. Slowly she spent less time with him, and more time with me. This wasn't as much because we got along well and cared for each other as it was about maintaining the early stages of what became a crippling drug addiction for the both of us. One night me and her had just gotten back to my place. We hung out on my trampoline with my dog for a while (the other love of my life, and another love story that ends painfully) as we tended to do, and she left. She texted me about 10 minutes later saying her boyfriend just broke up with her over text and then shut his phone off. I told her to come back so we could talk and I could comfort her a bit. We sat outside and had a long conversation, until I said I was going to go inside. She'd never been inside my place with me, and I hadn't exactly intended on inviting her in but clearly she took it that way, and she came in with me. One thing lead to another, we had sex. 

This obviously brought all my feelings for her right back to the surface and the next day, I was just about floating. I realized just how in love with her I was. However it slowly became clear to me that I was a rebound, that she didn't share the same feelings for me. Despite this, she regularly slept at my house with me. We would cuddle, occasionally have sex, say we loved each other etc. Over time we had to address the fact that I clearly wanted a serious relationship with her, while she wasn't after that. It lead to some strange ups and downs in our relationship, we would become more distant then gradually gravitate towards one another again. The reality is, we are very compatible people and she clearly has some level of feelings for me from my perspective, so it continues to confuse me that we're not on the same page here. Through the worst of a drug addiction that would claim a few years from both of us, we were the only constants in each other's lives who really understood each other and could properly be there for one another. We distanced ourselves from friends and family, as addicts do. We went through phases where one of us got clean for a while and helped the other one out, then eventually the clean one would fall off the wagon again and the cycle would repeat. I want to make clear that we were beneficial to each other's recovery for the vast majority of our struggles with this. We began to go down different paths and saw each other less and less, but when we would see each other it was to support each other, care for each other. We'd keep up contact fairly regularly as well, even if we wouldn't see each other for a while. 

I ended up getting clean for good first, and moving to another state as a part of my commitment to sobriety. This was 3 years down the road from when she broke up with her boyfriend. I was now 22, her 21. During this time she had been in a couple bad relationships, which I suffered to watch her go through as I loved her deeply. emotional and physical abuse involved in both. We continued our strange variation between friends and something slightly more, my feelings never changed. At one point, she had even cheated on a guy she was with at the time with me. Though she says they were on a break, and she's not usually one to lie to me, this guy is convinced they weren't. He's a manipulative sociopathic ass, so I tend to believe her but can't be sure. I helped her with recovery as much as I could, and through a very fucking difficult and scary time I was there as much as she'd let me be. She finally went to rehab for a second time, and it stuck. We were closer than ever, however she ended up dating another guy who abused the shit out of her. He went to jail for beating her ass in public finally, and we grew close again.

Things began to get a lot more sexual, a bit more intimate. But the dynamic of the relationship didn't truly change. She still viewed it as a platonic relationship, I wanted more. We had a falling out over this, we didn't talk for about a year. At the age of 23, her 22, we reconnected as we always do. We apologized to each other, I told her I spent that whole year thinking of her and not one day went by where it became easier to accept the separation. I told her I wasn't sure if my feelings for her would ever truly change much, and it may be smarter for me to be separate from her because I didn't expect hers to either. But I couldn't accept that, and I wanted a relationship with her, but it had to be strictly friendship. We absolutely could not go back to the sexual and emotionally charged relationship we had previously. She agreed, but I should not be surprised that this did not last. Fairly quickly we went back to how things were. I visit back home regularly, I only live 3 hours away. Every time I came we'd stay with each other most nights, we'd cuddle, we'd connect, and finally a couple months into being in each other's lives again we had sex. We get along so well and have so much fun together, the connection always finds it's way back.

I'm in a better place than I once was with this. I love her still without doubt, but I feel a bit more of a disconnect. I hadn't been able to be with anyone else in any way from the time we first had sex to the time we started talking again recently, because she was all I wanted. I believe I truly thought I'd wait until my dying fucking day for things to change. God I've never felt so strongly for another living being. But once we started talking again, I went on my first real date in nearly 5 years. It was a baby step, she was nice and we were compatible, we even had sex a few times (something which had been very difficult for me to do with anyone else but my friend) and I felt a bit of a connection, a bit of intimacy. But it became clear I was still hung up on my friend, and I cut it off before things went too far. I didn't want to hurt her. I've since plateau'd, no more progress towards individuality. My friend broke down crying to me recently, saying she felt bad that she hurts me, that she doesn't feel the same way. I empathize with that, I've been there in a much more minor situation. It's strange when you know you'd be good with someone, you even like them as a person and find them attractive to a degree, you feel a connection but you just can't bring yourself to feel how they do for some reason. I know she doesn't intend to hurt me and she truly cares about me. She's a good friend and I value our friendship highly. I'm just stuck. 

I have tried separation time and again, because I believed I'd never move on if I didn't, but I just cannot stand it. Even after a year. I can't hide from my feelings either, and of course, I crave the intimacy we share. Why is she unable to avoid this intimacy, the same as I can't, if she doesn't feel the same? If she genuinely feels bad about the fact that we are on different pages in respect to what we want from each other? Why does this shit have to be so damn complicated. Sometimes I feel numb to everything. Nothing excites me, I have achieved many great things since getting sober, I can't seem to congratulate myself. My inner voice is never happy with what I've accomplished, I always need to do more. In highschool I had a kind of unyielding confidence that now seems impossible to me. But with her I can be happy, I can accept her praise when I'm doing well, while praise from most others will be excused in my mind. She makes me a happier, more motivated, all around better person, but there's a duality there that makes me question if it's as much of a positive aspect of my life as it is a negative one. God, I love her. Why can't it just be simpler.

TL;DR My closest friend and I have an intimate connection, I love her and want to be with her but she does not feel the same, despite her behavior indicating otherwise.",/r/relationship_advice/comments/qn8vl5/my_relationship_with_my_closest_friend_is/,throwaway2021pma,male

I could write a short story on our history alone, never mind the events that surrounded and impacted it. After the year of separation we had I really thought we'd be able to come back at things a different way. I really thought we'd stick to boundaries set. This wasn't the first time we'd put distance for this purpose, but it was by far the longest. I just can't wrap my head around why we can't seem to stick to these boundaries, and why we are coming from such different places, yet ending up at the same destination in the first place. By rights it seems to me that I should be the one struggling with keeping these boundaries, why does she struggle as well?

"These things sound valid. I hadn't really thought of the emotional crutch thing. That's absolutely true, 100% of the time I'm the one she comes to when things start going badly in relationships, and most of the time I'm the only one. She usually gets the support she needs and then ends up going back. I hadn't viewed it that way before. You've absolutely been helpful. I'm nearly positive none of this is happening out of malicious intent of any kind, I agree. In the beginning there was a bit of toxicity but now, it seems to be that this has become how we operate and it's done without much forethought on the impact. It's sure easy to get lost in the comfort of this situation without viewing it as a whole. I knew going into it we needed boundaries and I quickly forgot about it the first time I saw her again. We were sitting on a boat launch late at night, we grew up in Vermont, she still lives there, and it's fucking beautiful at night. She was wearing one of my sweatshirts that was pretty big on her which is super cute and she fell asleep on my chest. That moment could have made me forget my own name.

You can't really do anything, as it always will have to 100% come from her. 

Consider this question:  If her hopes and dreams are really her hopes and dreams, shouldn't that fact be enough motivation?  I suspect that they may no longer be her aspirations, and she may be avoiding the fact that she won't be pursuing them any longer (or has failed in achieving them by now, or realized perhaps she wasted a good chunk of her time/life/efforts on this, and has nothing to show for it).

"Homie... alright, listen.

Sounds like your problem stems from porn comparison and experiencing some shallow women if they’re leaving you for the size. You’re average, that’s good.

Nobody is gonna settle for you in a relationship. They’re either gonna love you or not. Only they can decide how they feel. 

I know you said not to say size doesn’t matter. And you’re right. To a degree, it does. But most women don’t like fat cocks you see in porn. They hurt. Porn stars die from ODing on pain meds from too many of those. And a woman who would care about you isn’t going to leave you because of your dick. If that’s an issue for them then that’s not love.

Women are also into hooking up. The ones on media won’t admit it but lots of women do just want sex. If they don’t want to commit then that’s not your fault. Same when men don’t want to commit after sex.

I just got back from hooking up with a woman for the last 2 days. She said she normally doesn’t like large dicks because the g-spot is normally 3 inches deep. Anything after that is just for the fun of it.

Don’t be discouraged. Millions of women don’t want giant dicks. The ones you’re meeting are either shallow or just wanted to hook up.

I’ve interacted with women on the internet who told me that they married guys with small penises and they still cheated on the women.

The fact of the matter is you’re gonna run into women who care and women who don’t. Or women who actually prefer them smaller because they don’t hurt them as much.

As hard as it is to accept, women aren’t a hivemind. There’s no singular thought on dick sizes. And as hard as it is to accept, personality *does* play a role in them choosing a partner. The woman I hooked up with for the last 2 nights and I were talking about the dating scene. She said she really liked me because I was relaxed, receptive and easy to talk to. You being too insecure about your dick size and unwilling to see a woman’s perspective is gonna hurt you worse than your size. You can do it man.

You need to listen. Like honestly right now your glaring issue is that you’re not listening. You’re leaning very heavily towards confirmation bias. If you don’t want to listen then I won’t spend any more time on this but I wanted to try to share with you my experiences with women over the years.",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qn2v1t/what_do_i_do/hjdt4m2/,Mike_Hawk_Burns,male
"Yes because shocker, people are different. It’s almost like I said that. The comments are always way different answers because women aren’t hiveminds. There individuals. Some like bigger dicks. Some like smaller dicks. Some don’t care. Just like I said. One thing you have to realize is that personality *does* matter a lot. Women don’t want to be insufferable guys. Just like guys don’t want to be with insufferable women. If a woman is always putting herself down, you’re not gonna find that attractive. If she doesn’t listen to your words of reassurance then you’re not gonna find that attractive. If she has tits the opposite size that you like or if they’re just small enough that their exes always made fun of her for the small size, she’s gonna be super insecure and not listen to you. And that’s gonna drive you nuts. 

Well, the mirror is true for women. If a man isn’t gonna listen to her, she isn’t gonna find him attractive. It doesn’t matter if he has a 6 pack and does sex well. If he doesn’t listen then that’s gonna be a bad relationship and she’s gonna leave. 

Again, the hard truth is some women like bigger dicks. Some don’t. They aren’t hiveminds. You’re bound to run into some who prefer bigger dicks and you’re bound to run into some who don’t. But if your personality (listening skills, being insufferable, etc) are bad, then you’re not going to even get to the sex part. Or you’re not going to make it past the 1st date. It doesn’t matter if you look good or if you have a big dick.

Maybe part of you is getting stuck inside your own head, telling yourself you're not enjoying hanging out with other people, and that it's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Can't do much about it, except listen to your partner, see if they have any concerns, and try the best you can. The upshot is that they have to do the same. Neither gender has a monopoly on cheating.

Anyway, like another poster said, talk to your friend and maybe help him realize he's being a POS. Empathy seems like a good approach. Try to get him to put himself in her shoes.

"Wanting to make up with my ex boyfriend after I fudged up
Hey,

Well after now thinking almost a week on what I did wrong with my ex I would like to make up with him. I mean I wrote him an email already stating that I am sorry and that I honestly should have thought before speaking and I shouldn't have talked to him this way.

I do not know what else I should be doing anymore. I don't think he is going to answer that email anymore. What else could I do to show him that I honestly am sorry and that I honestly would like to make up with him again?

I know I fudged up, I know I should have watched my words a thousand million times, I know he should not have go under my nagging and I dug my own grave here but I would love to make up with him.

Even though I have been terrible the past few times, I love him and actually just want him to be happy and seeing a future with him. I cannot beg him via email as that would surely annoy him. I cannot go to him with flowers since I am living over the ocean away from him.

I know I am overreacting waiting almost an hour on a reply right now but I kinda feel that my ears are turning red and mostly when that happens it means he has read my email and laughs at it because he thinks I do not mean it seriously.

I do mean it seriously. I love him and I would like to resolve everything I do not want to lose him even though I deserve that he leaves my butt and never ever talks to me again especially after I said the stuff with ""You are selfish and work on yourself to treat girls better maybe our paths cross one day"" and basically yelling and nagging on him because his phone was being dumb and left me on read for no reason.

Please help me even when I do not deserve any help or him getting back with me / forgiving me. I know I am being annoying with my stupid questions but I honestly want to fix everything. I honestly love him. And I honestly am sorry.",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qid4v3/wanting_to_make_up_with_my_ex_boyfriend_after_i/,ms_ryoko_chan,female

I shouldn’t have talked to you this way. I should slowly learn how to calmly and maturely explain stuff without ending in me getting frustrated and yelling at you. You will be having a reason why you left me on read.  
I should have asked nicely. I understand you’re hurt and I honestly want to genuinely apologize on my behalf and own my mistake. I know frustration and anger should not be used as an excuse to treat your partner terribly.  
I should have thought before doing something. Or at least hugged you and stopped this mess. I crossed a line and hurt your heart and I am sorry I went this far to hurt you.

we are 20 F almost 21 and 22 M. 

>Be patient, its not the end of the world. And for christs sake give the man some damn space. He'll respond to you when he wants to and when he can. Chill.

Thing is he will not reply until I apologized rightfully to him. He will ignore me and stuff. 4 days ago I wrote him an email saying ""Could you please hear me out"" he never replied  because he never replies to such questions just only when I am apologizing after I fudged up.

I waited now almost a week on everything he never replied he doesn't want to hear me out, I feel like I am going to lose him. I know I apologized alone this year a billion times after fudging up but it feels like this time everything is lost.

It's been an hour and I honestly do not know what else to say. I honestly meant my words in this email with the apology. I honestly am working on myself, I honestly am trying to be calmer, I am honestly trying every time to be chill but just when he is mad and blocked me I just do not know when I will be unblocked, how I can make him understand my words and how him that I am honestly sorry.

Because he is in North America and I am in Europe. I do not know how I would be able to get there in the next 30 minutes. I do not have any money and if I would like come even over I wouldn't know where he lives because he moved and I forgot to ask for his address (I only know from his childhood home but like he moved like a year ago and basically since I am anyways now in Europe since I was born and raised here and will be for a couple more years I forgot to ask),/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qid4v3/wanting_to_make_up_with_my_ex_boyfriend_after_i/hiinwgn/,ms_ryoko_chan,female
"You're right but firstly to get to this point I need him to unblock me and honestly that's not really easy to get to this point. Since it is long distance he has blocked me on Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and Wattpad and only thing I could reach him is his email.

I wrote him an email going like:  
""Dear \*nickname of his name\* bear,  
I shouldn’t have talked to you this way. I should slowly learn how to calmly and maturely explain stuff without ending in me getting frustrated and yelling at you. You will be having a reason why you left me on read.

It has been a few hours he still hasn't texted me back. Something in my mind tells me he is not taking this apology since I know his philosophy of ""Apologies are just words with no meaning anymore"".

He would only unblock me when I am getting together a good apology yet Idk if this apology was good enough. I honestly am working on myself I honestly want us to be together but my mind is just so messed with ***leaving on read = no loving me / really wanting to hurt me***.

I know he loves me, I know it deep down but I still am working on forgiving him for stuff he did to me that wasn't that nice. I don't fully trust him. Like only to 70% this is why my head keeps jumping to conclusion and assuming and losing my temper and being just overall not sane anymore.

Honestly I have fallen for him cause he was one of the first who validated me and basically treated me better (in the beginning before I fudged up). I would love to get a last chance but I honestly do not know anymore.

It kinda hurts that is has now been 2 almost 3 hours and he no gives a damn of this relationship. I mean I deserve being dumped and I deserve that all here actually the fact you talk with me so nicely is actually something I do not deserve after fudging up but I would love to save it and at least get a last chance.

I mean his family and friends are against me, not cause Long Distance rather cause they see I am terrible, he stood up for me and gave gave gave and I just used each chance and fudged up.

Just I have been so long in love with him and we have built up almost 4 years of a relationship that I do not want to give up so easily for nothing. I probably am way too obsessed and need to work on that for this or next relationship.

I’m going to come out and admit that my reply is coming from a place of annoyance. It’s ridiculous to ask such a question.

You’re coming from a real twisted view of reality. Yes, men do want to have a beautiful relationship with a woman. No, we don’t all want blondes. In fact it’s like you don’t even look at the world around you which may be part of the problem with your own struggles. There’s plenty of women out there walking in public and holding hands with men. These women are all hair colors. Brunette, blonde, red, brown, dyed, whatever. There’s plenty of women out there who are obese/curvy/slightly overweight/thin/athletic in caring and committed relationships. There’s plenty of women out there who aren’t white and don’t dye their hair blonde who are in committed and loving relationships. There’s plenty of women out there who are college graduates, intelligent women in committed relationships. It’s more than foolish to think we live in this 1950s era stereotype that all men want thin dumb blondes.

Sometimes I feel like people’s problem is they lack awareness and empathy in general and that’s why they have bad luck with dating in general.",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qhz1gi/do_men_want_a_genuine_beautiful_relationship_with/hign049/,Mike_Hawk_Burns,male

"Alright so from personal experience, the flaking comes down to a few different options.

1) too much time passed. If they’re telling you that you’re beautiful and they want to meet you and all that, chances are they’re being truthful. But if we have to wait a long time to meet you then we’re going to lose interest over time. I’m in a similar situation atm. I met a woman on tinder almost 2 weeks ago. We were supposed to meet last weekend but I got sick. We were supposed to meet on Tuesday but I was still sick. We’re trying again for this weekend. Each day I talk to her, I still like her but I’m losing interest because there’s only so much you can say or do over text. This does not mean it’s your fault. Schedules are a bitch. For her and I, we can only meet at certain times due to schedules. But again if so much time passes then it’s just kinda hard to keep interest if you can’t physically meet someone.

2) if a guy is noncommittal to meeting you then you’re probably wasting energy on him. If we want to meet you, we’ll be committal. He might have just wanted attention from you with no intentions of meeting.

3) the guy who wanted to meet at your place just wanted sex. He didn’t really flake on you as much as your goals didn’t align. You did good standing up for yourself and saying you didn’t want to do that right away.

4) I think the other sub only has trusted members post because some women tend to post really passive aggressive questions there that anger guys and your post title of “why do men flake?” would be seen as passive aggressive rather than “why did these guys flake?”

Basically I’d say you aren’t at fault for any of these encounters. Guy #1 probably lost interest because too much time passed. Guy #2 probably just wanted attention from women. Guy #3 just wanted sex.

"Curious this is an ask men sub to seek perspective and seeing some women comment perspective on how men think. 

There’s a couple things to consider here. First off, are you/he local to your area? Meaning have you or him grown up in the area and is it possible that he knows the girls?

If he’s not chatting them up then it’s not really problematic. Sometimes guys will look at others but have no desire to approach them. If he’s indeed messaging them and flirting with them again then I’d just move on. Him lying about following them is problematic but his point of view may be different. He may want to see something different but that’s it. It’s natural for guys to be that way. But if he does message then you’ve got a problem.

Your looks don’t sound like a problem to him but I’m unsure on your personality. Contrary to what pop culture says about men, we do in fact care about personality in relationships. You’ve got to make sure you’re not being emotionally aggressive to him. I’ve been in a couple of emotionally abusive relationships where they would be upset at me for having female friends because they were insecure and it made me drawn to other women emotionally because they weren’t being emotionally abusive to me. Now granted I never cheated but those sorts of things are what made me look at other women.

If he’s continuously lying then there’s nothing wrong with leaving him now because he’d just be showing no respect by continuing to not tell the truth.

In conclusion, him following local girls isn’t necessarily an issue so long as he’s not chatting with them. If he’s chatting with them then you should leave. If he’s lying to you even recently then leave you should leave. There’s reasons guys would look at other girls and even be platonically friendly to them but the moment the line is crossed from platonic to flirting, you should leave. Make sure to reflect on yourself so that you aren’t being aggressive/toxic without realizing it. The choice is yours but sounds like he’s lied a lot and if that’s the case then the relationship isn’t going to last regardless",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qgmkzt/boyfriend_22m_follows_girls_on_ig_attainable_and/hi7ghoe/,Mike_Hawk_Burns,male

"Man relationship problem?
Hello I have some kind of problem that I do not know what to do about. I am confused by this guy. The last time I fucked up I admit this but this time I do not think I fucked up or even did anything wrong. I have no idea why he blocked me this time.

Basically to put all things first I am 20 almost 21F and he is 22M. We were in a long distance relationship and basically this time I have been blocked after he snapped because of me gaming (?) I think. 

I cannot pin point what went wrong. It all started when he left me on read (despite him doing nothing 3 seconds earlier and him being at home not at work, not at a store, nothing) I waited 40 minutes to an hour and texted him a screenshot saying ""\*his name\* you left me on read. This is now the 5th time today I am getting annoyed. Why are you doing this?""

He wasn't having it and yelled at me that it wasn't him, I replied with the screenshot again and said But I got a proof that it was you. Who else would it be. He then rambled something about men are always wrong and women are always right and how stupid he is (I didn't say anything besides that isn't true and you know it \*his name\*)

He then spammed me letter by letter I  D I D  N O T  L E A V E  Y O U  O N  R E A D. I said but the screenshot and he was yelling at me at this point ""KNOW WHAT THEN FUCK WHAT I HAVE PLANNED ON MY DAY OFF"". I said what have you planned he said ""Well fuck this I am an ass in your eyes so why should I do something"".

I asked again (because I know he would say it by second time and he likes it when I ask about his plans ) he said Nah not saying it. Then he spelled ""Know what bye"" 4 times and I was playing something on the side because I was finally having some free time (haven't played a game since 4 months now due to studying and other things)

He wasn't having that as well and yelled ""WOW AND NOW IGNORING ME BYE BYE BYE"" I was like ""No I just am trying to game some since I haven't gamed in a long time. He was saying ""Gaming is more important than me bye bye""

I was then so frustrated and said like ""It did kill the cute mood forget the cute things"" and he was saying more bye. I asked why and he said ""Bc Bye"" I then explained to him ""You left me now the 5th time alone today on read, didn't apologize or at least give me an explanation.""

""I am crying because I am not even getting told an explanation but only bye bye bye. But fine if you want bye then who am I to change your mind. I asked now a thousand times nicely for an explanation and all I am getting is bye. But at least delete my nudes if you really are choosing to do bye, promise me that""

He then yelled at me again ""I AM NOT EVEN LOOKING AT THE DAMN MESSAGES AND IT BEING FUCKING READ. Know what"" \*then he blocked me\*

I wrote him then a day later an email saying stuff on wishing him the best in life, I hope he at least treats the next girl better (cause honestly you can't tell me leaving someone on read for no reason when you absolutely do nothing is fair. Neither is being yelled at and blocked / silent treatment) and maybe one day our paths will cross again.

I know I haven't been a good girlfriend either with treating him terribly but I am not getting clever out of what I did wrong that made him block me. I didn't yell at him, I didn't spam, I didn't assume things, I had even a prove on that he left me on read.

I just wanna know what I did wrong because honestly in my head it sounds like I did nothing wrong. Maybe the email with saying I wish him the best bla bla was kinda hurting him I must admit that but what else could I have been doing wrong because he wouldn't even want to hear me out or anything.

I am really on the edge reading now since 3 days those goddamn messages up and down and I have no idea what I did wrong.  Please help me figuring it out.",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qg1if8/man_relationship_problem/,ms_ryoko_chan,female
"Maybe youre right but also maybe I frustrated him sexually. I mean we had sex chat before and I simply said I dont wanna do this cause he simply yelled at me that this wasn't him and kinda it ruined my mood.

i simply didn't do anything this time. I dont know what I did. I simply am sitting here since 3 days trying to figure it out and I have written him an email yesterday asking to hear me out and all I got from this email was red ears and hiccup.

But same time if he really got frustrated from me saying na me no wanna do sex chat then he should be having his emotions more in control because it isn't my fault when he yells at me and my mood gets down.

Same time he complains about me wanting too much sex chat even though I only want it 2 times a week and yet he shoves my wanting to have sex on birth control / my hormonal inbalance.",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qg1if8/man_relationship_problem/hi3h1u3/,ms_ryoko_chan,female
"I mean yes he made his mistakes but I am not a saint either. I mean his views in relationships are kinda messed up as his mother re-married a million times, has kids from different men and that actually is upsetting him.

One time he started to cry because of the fact that my mom and dad were married, even after my father's death 12 years ago mom never married and I have a ""full blood"" sister and he has only a half sister. (I didn't rub it under his nose or said anything he broke suddenly at night down and cried about that)

My mistakes in the relationship were my toxicity with:

* yelling
* spamming
* spam calling
* not forgiving him
* guilt tripping
* living in the past
* not letting him time to breath (with gaming, letting him spend time with his family, letting him sleep, etc.)
* ""forcing"" him to learn my language
* forcing him to save to come see me (even though he didn't anyways)
* almost costing him his job with spam calling

His mistakes were:

* not communicating
* doing tattoos over me
* wasting money on idiot stuff (Spotify Premium, Discord Nitro, any TV subscribtion, YouTube Premium, his tattoos, consoles he can't afford, apple watch, ipad with pencil (even though he no use that and couldn't actually afford it but stretched his budget out and asked then his mom to chip in), eating daily out, going to Starbucks way too many times, and I don't assume that he told me that proudly)
* Keep saying he has barely money but wasting money on other things that he actually has no money for.
* making love chats with the girl I was jealous about because she flirted with him and wanted with him just to mess with me when I am not going to stop being jealous he gonna actually date her
* he went with her to her first tattoo cause she needed his ""advice"" cause he got so many but she didn't go with her boyfriend or her friends but wanted to go with my then boyfriend
* silent treatment
* bragging with his tattoos even though he hurts me with them and he knows it hurt me
* blocking me
* keep saying how childish I am for not having a job and only being a full time student and how I am not allowed to be frustrated as I am just studying and he is working in retail and he is working 9 hours 6 days a week and he is allowed to sleep earlier and be frustrated and me not cause studying at university is nothing compared to working in retail

We are both no saints, I did too things that were not nice to him but kinda he never actually apologized for what he did he only said ""sry"", ""sorry"", ""I am sorry"" with not saying why he is sorry.

But I am at least trying to work on myself and apologizing and making up with him and tell him what I am sorry for. I mean I am full of myself and probably not apologizing rightfully and doing same things over and over.

I mean I love him but either needs to work on themselves but I would like to make up with him but I kinda feel so weird in my tummy each day for not apologizing.

I kinda it feels like he is going to forget me or doesn't say Happy Birthday in 11 days to my birthday because I am being mean. I mean I understand but I too said happy birthday to him.

Maybe I am entitled and think I am something better to want him to say happy birthday as I did something wrong (even though I do not know what I did wrong this time).

I just hope things would end up for the better and we make up and maybe the relationship ends up in a new beginning but I think the more I wait the more he's going to move on and date someone else...

I've read through it and even seen a few comments left by users but I don't really get it, most seem to imply that women and men can't be friends prior to rejection, and it made me think about something that I've done, I have rejected some male friends before, afterwards I told them that we can still be friends and nothing has changed from then, we still laugh and play video games together, am I wrong for doing so?",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qfed6c/maybe_im_dense_but_can_i_get_some_guys_thoughts/,nijiroflavor,female
"People’s reactions often assume that humans are cookie cutter. We’re not. We’re different in many ways. One way is how we handle rejection. Some people handle rejection well and don’t see it as a big deal. Others may handle it well but can’t continue to be friends because their purpose of the friendship was to be romantic and when the rejection hits, you can’t really stand to be around someone anymore because you want to give them your heart but they don’t want to accept it.

Then there’s people who don’t handle rejection well at all and feel the need to cut off all contact because their feelings are hurt or they don’t know how to process rejection. And then there’s some who handle rejection differently on a per person basis. Some people can cope with being rejected by this person and still be friends but can’t with this other person.

Your friends who you’ve rejected likely fall into the handling rejection well or handling rejection from a specific person (you) well. Basically this long winded reply is saying: no you’re not wrong for doing so and your friends who accept being friends after rejection are those who handled it well",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/qfed6c/maybe_im_dense_but_can_i_get_some_guys_thoughts/hhz5zw3/,Mike_Hawk_Burns,male

Nothing to feel bad about. He was playing both sides and respecting none. You did the right thing with the right intentions.

"Redpill is basically cult of men telling others that women are naturally submissive and to treat them like shit. Listening to them, pickup artists and all that other nonsense is horrible.

I feel you homie. I’m 23 and I’ve struggled with dating since my ex fiancé broke it off with me and married some white supremacist asshole and I’ve never been the same since. But don’t listen to those cults.

In my experience, women don’t want that shit that these cults spout. In the last week alone I’ve gotten a few matches on tinder and in the last month, I’ve been called handsome by about 7 women. 3 of them told me that they want to be in a relationship with me. Tomorrow I’m gonna hookup with one of them. She told me that she’s been aroused since talking to me. Why?

Because I’ve treated her like a person. I’ve not put her on a pedestal, i don’t treat her like filth. I don’t overanalyze what she’s saying/thinking. I’m kind, understanding, naturally myself. I listen to her problems and converse with her. I make remarks about how pretty she and smart she is. 

Basically you need to stop overanalyzing. It’s too much and it’s meaningless. These things that you’re listening to are full of misinformation and bullshit. You need to be you. I’ve been rejected literally hundreds of times. It sucks. It demoralized me. Made me want to give up. But I just kept trying. You should do the same.

"It's not that being nice won't get you anywhere. It's more like, being nice isn't a silver bullet. If a woman is dating an enormous asshole, it's despite the fact that he's a prick, not because of it.

There are a couple things at play here:

1. A manipulative asshole doesn't immediately abuse his (or her) partner. They have to bide their time, so they don't scare them away. Their toxic behavior is something they slowly let out, gradually pushing the boundaries, while being savvy enough to reel back in the poor sucker any time they go too far.
2. People who are assholes also tend to be more confident and take more risks. Since it's on the onus of the man to woo the woman, taking more risks with flirting with them or asking them out will naturally lead to more success, since they try more often.

As to your specific situation, there are a couple of red flags here. It sounds to me like you and her were rushing into things. And I'll bet money that she still had feelings for her ex, and was using you as a rebound, consciously or no.

The fact that he's crazy, a stalker, hooked up with other women? Yeah, no. She tolerated that. There were other reasons that she fell for him, and it's anyone's guess what they were, but absolutely no woman walks into a relationship thinking ""Gosh, I hope he cheats on me.""

Whatever she likes about him is irrelevant. The point is that if on top of all that, he was as nice as you, they'd still be together, and no other guy would have a chance. His advantage is that he already captured her heart, and she didn't have the strength or insight to turn her back on him. That's why he was able to get her back.

Not blaming her, mind you. Even the most sensible out of all of us, who can recognize toxic behavior, will suddenly find ourselves making excuses or blaming ourselves when our partner abuses us.

Anyway, I'm rambling. Keep being nice, and being yourself. If you want to modify your behavior to improve your odds, become more confident in yourself. The more confident in yourself you are, the more it'll inspire other people to be confident in you.",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/q789u5/should_i_stop_being_the_nice_guy/hghb2eo/,DannyDreaddit,male

The mistake you made is that when you confessed your feelings she said no, but you didn't hear it.

I told him, he said he loves me too and he likes me, but he is too scared of how it will end.. he told me a lot of his thoughts and he is scared of starting a relationship with me because he thinks he will lose me or I will get bored of him.. which is very sad.. I never did and I would never do because I feel like we are soulmates(same attitude, same personality, same music taste, everything is the same). I really like him and he is an amazing guy...

I do not really know what to believe. His thoughts are very powerful to him.. I tried to make him change at this point, not about relationship, about everything. He always puts the bad before the good.. and it is not ok. I try to explain it to him but he doesn't want to understand. He thinks everyone wants to hurt him and he does not want anyone around.. I can feel like he still has something inside there for me but he just doesn't show..

You sound like you'd like to 'rescue' her. You can't. Some people are just born broken and others become broken. You can't put her back together.

When someone shows you who they are, believe them. She has shown you. You need to let her go and move on.

Focus on yourself and work on becoming the man that your life partner will fall in love with when she meets you.

I don't have good advice beyond run of the mill talk therapy, possibly medication if you're diagnosed with a mental disorder.

Are there any activities that you enjoy, or think you would? Why don't you try a martial art? Lots of fun, good exercise, and you meet cool people. Given your apparent lack of human connection (internet friends don't count), I think some kind of group activity would be beneficial.

That she can have both of you. That she can have the security of a relationship with you and still fish for and revel in attention from other men.

"Do guys talk to girls based on their outfits?
Hi! I (18 f) thought that it would be appropriate to ask this question on this subreddit to gain some male perspectives on my situation. I will try to keep my question concise so that I will not bore you all, but I will also try to not make it vague.

Okay, so, for the past few weeks of my first-year at university, I was wearing some pretty nice and aesthetic outfits. Female students at my university complimented my outfits, started a conversation and asked for my IG. Although, this was opposite with the male students in my classes during the first few weeks. No guy started a conversation with me, asked for my IG, etc. They were comfortable asking other female students though.

This week and last week (at my university) was midterm week. Since it was (and still is) midterm week, I wear baggy, comfy clothes and tie my hair in a ponytail since it's the easiest ""outfit"" to put on. I just take what I see, tie my hair and leave. I don't really put any effort into my outfits anymore because midterms have been on my mind 24/7. Today and last week, I was wearing sweatpants, a t-shirt and a jacket. For some reason, guys have been talking to me now? Last week someone asked me for my Instagram and another started talking to me on the sidewalk once we finished our midterm. I find this odd because when I wore nice outfits, males did not talk to me, but when I don't even try and just wear whatever tf I feel like wearing that day, they do? Is there a reason why? I am genuinely so confused. Is there a particular reason why this is? Do I just look better with baggy clothes and messy hair than aesthetic clothes and straightened hair? What's the deal?

And before you say anything/say ""dress for yourself"", yes, I am aware. I do not dress to impress males, my fashion style just varies depending on the mood I am in. Also, I am asking this because this is what I have been noticing/observing. Any answer would help my curiosity! Thank you. :)

"is my gf trying to guilt trip me into spending money? Am I being an asshole for standing my ground and saying no?
So basically, she used to have a dog that she gave to her mom cause she couldn't take care of him. Her mom loves that dog. Recently the dog became sick and her mom was understandably despondent and very heartbroken. Chances are he will live on for a while but it's definitely confirmation that he's getting older and isn't as healthy as he used to be.

It's felt like my gf has been dropping a lot of hints that she wants me to spend money to fly to her mom and see the dog, like ""I sure wish my dog could see her brother before he passes away..."", and ""oh I really wish I could be there to help my mom..."". So I said pretty explicitly ""are you saying you want to go?"", and she said yes, but followed with ""but it's expensive"". It felt like she was nudging me with ""you should pay for it""

I felt this in the past too. For example, I drive a shitbox of a car but I don't care because it works. She would frequently push me to get a new car, and not just any car, but a Tesla. I could easily afford it, but to me a car is a liability. I'm not spending money on something that just plummets in value if I don't have to. The money would be better put towards investments or a house. Similarly, she always pushes me to get a more expensive apartment, or move to a high floor in our high rise (*extremely* expensive). I ask if she's gonna put any towards rent and she just kinda says no and drops the subject. She's explained that since she's always been poor, the idea of these new shiny things is appealing to her. I explain that it's an easy way to STAY poor if you keep pursuing material liabilities that depreciate in value

I feel like kind of an asshole cause I do get it, one of your dogs passing is just the worst feeling. But at the same time, I've been telling her for *months*, almost *endlessly,* that she needs to start saving more money. Her budgeting was incredibly poor and I felt she was living a terribly unsustainable lifestyle. When this came, I recommended maybe we just split the airfare 3 ways -- her mom, me, and her. It wouldn't be much if we did that. I find out that she can't even afford that.

Now I wanna tell her frankly, this is her own fault. She had months to save an emergency fund but *chose* not to, so this should serve as a lesson that she needs to start being more responsible. I'm not here to bail her out when she needs it.

On the other hand I feel like I'm being a bit of a dick to everyone else involved. She won't get to see her dog and that's really sad. Her mom is very sad about her dog.

I felt she was being dramatic -- some of the jobs were the easiest shit ever (one was a movie theater I went to frequently, the employee work vibes seemed *real* chill)

She's been studying computer science to get a programming job, but I find some concerns. She wanted to make her friend a website, and I said that would be a great idea and set up everything she needed to make a really good website with SEO and everything. I basically just left making it look pretty to her, which she's good at. She looked at it blankly for a few minutes and quit and said ""it's too complicated and I don't get it"". I told her, ""you think you can just say that when you're on the job...?"". I also help her with her computer science homework, frequently :\\

Honestly feels like she's been regressing cause when we met she had no problem working full time and actually tended to outpace other employees.

The longer you spend with a person you don't intend to grow old with, the fewer chances you'll have to meet the person you do.

Consider this: The last time you and this girl you don't really love went out together, the actual girl of your dreams was in the same place, saw you, got hit by the lightning bolt of instant attraction, but then saw you were with someone and said too bad, he's taken. And left.

"Guys, why do some guys get upset when you tell them that you aren't attracted to them in a way that they'd like you to be? Do they not know that there are different factors into what makes a person attractive?
Attraction, a quality that makes one person feel drawn towards another person. There are five types of attraction: Sexual, Romantic, Sensual, Aesthetic and Emotional Attraction, but one of the types mentioned above may keep someone hanging on more than the others and for all the wrong reasons too. For context, I'm demisexual, demisexuality is a sexual orientation where a person can only feel sexual/romantic attraction with the person on the receiving end only when they establish a strong emotional connection towards them. What does this mean for me? I'll probably die alone xD but that I can also see way beyond a person than the size of their ahem,, joysticks since I found out that it matters to some guys [ and I won't shame whoever feels this way because their feelings are totally valid but if you're going to show someone your junk, please let it be with someone who is okay with it as consent goes along way. ]

Yet, whenever I tell a guy that I'm not interested in them for their physical appearance, they'd get upset, some of them even insult me, telling me that I'm ugly and what not. It's frustrating. If only they could see that the reason I fell in love with them in the first place is for their personalities, not their looks.  

What's your take on this?

Edit: What I mean to say is that I fell in love with them for who they are as a person, not for their looks. I apologize for my wording, I was upset at the time. ❤️",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/pzb8wy/guys_why_do_some_guys_get_upset_when_you_tell/,nijiroflavor,female

"This is a difficult one. I've had friends in similar situations and have offered my advice, but long-distance online relationships are generally pretty hard to maintain.

Ask yourself this: will you be able to remain friends and *not feel hurt* if she finds a boyfriend? Will it be worth it to remain *only friends* and see her go through her life happy and meeting guys and being without you in that way? Can you do that?

If no, then you have a pretty easy answer: tell her you've developed feelings for her over the time you've chatted and want to know what she thinks. Take it slow, don't tell her you're in love with her, don't ask to be in a relationship, just see what she thinks of that. If she turns you down then you have your answer and you can move on and don't need to hurt yourself by seeing her progress through stages of her life with other guys. If she doesn't turn you down then awesome.

If you *can* handle not being together and seeing her go through life with different guys, then that's even more difficult. Weigh the odds and figure out what ***you*** want. Don't worry about scaring her away, worry about expressing *your true self*. You don't help yourself by suppressing your feelings and in the end will only end up hurting yourself if you lie to yourself about how you feel about her. But again, if you feel like you're completely happy being just friends, you can keep on at it and if your feelings grow for her over the next little while you can bring that up.

I'm one who says to not lie to yourself and to express your true feelings to someone in situations like this, regardless of the potential negative outcome. Your best friend is saying to tell her how you feel, it seems like if you continue talking and playing games online with her you'll continue to develop and grow feelings for her, so you might as well bite the bullet now so you can either get a good response or a negative one and move on more easily. She also seems like the kind of girl (from what you described) who would be very understanding if you admitted to having feelings and she didn't feel the same way, assuming you were mature about it and had no problem remaining close friends.

"I still feel horrible about it.

About 8 years ago, I was dating a girl who was visiting from another country on the other side of the planet. We were basically friends with benefits for a few months but both of us ended up getting feelings for each other and we decided to make it official. Things were great, we had similar interests and hobbies and things to talk about and so on. Her work visa was expiring in June and she had the very simple task of sending an application to her home country two months before it expired to ensure it was renewed and she didn't have to go back home to renew it.

Well April came and went, and she didn't send an application in. I bugged her about it and she seemed very... careless. She'd brush it off. May came and went and for some reason she still didn't renew it, and it got to the point where I was quite annoyed that she's putting it off for seemingly no reason. I'd bring it up, she'd say she forgot or she'll do it soon, then she just never did it.

Eventually June came and she had to go back home to renew her visa. She said it'd take about three months. We agreed to keep the relationship going and wait out the three months, but as our relationship was maybe six months old at best, that would end up being a third of our relationship spent apart. Either way, we said we'll Skype and text a lot and so on.

Well after a month I went to a party with some friends. The combination of being annoyed that my girlfriend hadn't even bothered to try to stay in the country with me, coupled with being alone for a month allowed me to meet a girl at the party who I clicked with immediately. We ended up spending the whole summer together and she filled the void.

I never told my girlfriend, and she ended up coming back in September but things obviously weren't the same and things died out pretty quick. After a month or two I told her the truth and obviously she was very hurt. I felt absolutely horrible, to the point where I didn't even bother to continue seeing the other girl. I still feel horrible to this day, and for a few years after we broke up I'd send her Facebook messages for her birthday and Christmas and check in on her to see how she's doing. Haven't talked to her in a long time but we're friends on Facebook and she seems to be doing well, which is all I can ask for.

"Help getting out of relationship fever?
Hi everyone,

I'm an M21 college student, and I've been feeling kinda weird for the last few months. I didn't know how to describe it until I stumbled upon an unrelated post on another sub: I'm pretty sure I'm in some kind of relationship fever.

By this, I mean that a significant portion of my day is spent dealing with what I'm assuming is a biological urge to find a partner. I've been in ""I want to smash ASAP"" phases before, but this is completely different; yeah it would be nice, but it's not \*the thing\* I want. The constant thoughts are really annoying, and in the short term at least, I really wish I'd be able to find some way to get it to stop.

I've read a few similar threads, and there seem to be two general pieces of advice: ""go to the gym"" and ""work on yourself"". I've gone to the gym semi-frequently in the last few weeks (fine), but I've been working on myself my entire life and these thoughts are literally holding me back from doing so.

Some more tangential information: I haven't been in a relationship before, and I've been diagnosed with ADHD (medicated). I also have several other, less relevant conditions, which I can elaborate on if necessary.

I'm sure I'm not the only one to be going through this, so any anecdotes/advice would be much appreciated :)",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/pudpma/help_getting_out_of_relationship_fever/,EsWarIn1780,male

">The best thing you could do is to look for someone you get along with easily and have lots of fun with, maybe someone from your friends or acquaintances, and see if a romantic relationship can start from there. Try to talk to new people, join clubs and see if you can meet people who share the same interests as you.

that's the hard part lol, I have zero friends who are girls and the main club I'm involved in is 95% male (competitive gaming), since I'm around the same people who have similar interests and backgrounds every day it's pretty boring; a huge component is that I just want to do something new

That being said, I’d look closer into him. If he’s constantly trying to control what you’re wearing, who you talk to and such then it’s possible he’s trying to control you or is projecting himself onto you.

"No relationship is 50/50. It's not a restaurant check you can parse and split. At any given moment it can be 60/40, 0/100, etc. There are phases when one partner needs more from the other than they can give to the other. 

Examples: one partner working full time so the other can finish college, med school, etc. Or one partner working two jobs because the other wants to stay home and raise children until they are old enough to be in school all day, instead of letting them be raised by day care strangers. One taking care of all the household chores while the other grieves for the loss of a family member, even if that grieving lasts for weeks or months.

So no, as a man, I never expect a relationship to be 50/50. I expect each of us to love the other enough to give our all when the other needs it.

To find a man you’re talking about, there’s actually a decent number out there. In my personal experience, some of them are on the slightly-overweight/chubby size, others tall and slim. So if you’re willing to look past that then you’ll find a decent number there.

There are some out there on some dating apps. Pick through tinder and only swipe right on guys you get good vibes from and tell them up front that you want a relationship (it’s why reading profiles is important). Same with bumble. Okcupid is okay but it’s a crapshoot.

"How can I apologize to my boyfriend
Hey Reddit,

well 27 days ago I made already a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/p8psug/how_do_you_apologize_to_a_man_after_you_fucked_up/) asking how I could get my boyfriend to unblock me. Well it happened again. This time because I have been toxic to him. It has now been almost 2 weeks, no sign of him.

I miss him tbh but he seems like that he is doing either ghosting or no contact with me. I am actively trying to better myself. I have improved in little steps from the last time. Yet 14 days ago I kind of damned up again but this time cause I was toxic to him.

I am not proud of it, I do not want anybody's pity as I anyways do not deserve it but the only thing I just would like to know is:

1.) As he does ***no-contact*** how long does it take for him to be a bit calmer? I have texted him 5 days ago a last time an apologetic email but Idk he has never responded, yet any time around 2 pm my time until I go to bed at 11 pm I get so many hiccups and I think he is thinking of me.

2.) ***After I worked on myself***, what could I write in ***my email to make up*** with him?

3.) ***Would it be too long if I now work on myself for a year or few years***? We have been together for almost 4 years and well I am just so afraid the longer I wait the more he will move on and forget about me.

4.) ***What if he never wants to hear me again after no-contact?*** Do I need to then move on? Do I need to try it again in a few years? I honestly do not want to lose him as I really didn't mean to hurt him. I understand my chances are limited and one day he will walk away but I just have some hopes still in my heart because I actively am working on myself.

I am sorry for asking stupid questions, I just do not know what else I could do. I recognise that I am the problem since I have been toxic and called him names, made him feel bad, etc. I understand that I do not deserve another chance.

I just want to try it anyways since I am a) working on myself and b) because he matters to me. I know if he wants space and no talk to me like he does with no replying to my emails and blocking me out of his life I cannot do much but I just want to try a last thing.

Best thing you can do is work on yourself. Ignore her, forget about her, go to the gym, go out with friends, go on a trip, work hard for a promotion, pick up a hobby, etc.

Someone who treats you like that isn't worth your time. You're definitely going to be thinking about her for a long time, but eventually you'll get over her. I've been in a very similar situation and I thought I'd never get over the girl. Well, I did.

"Is it normal that I sometimes get ""tired"" of my gf's insecurities?
Of course like anyone else I have my own insecurities. I'm short (5'10), not great looking, not the smartest or most charismatic, can't grow a beard, etc. These things I can't really change so I just shrug and move on with life. Other things, like my social skills, are kinda lacking but I figure I can always actively work to improve those so I may be insecure about it now but can be aware of it and improve.

She seems to focus on her insecurities a lot more. She would often cancel plans saying she feels ""too fat"" or ""not attractive"", despite the fact at least I think she looks very good. Other times, I found her unwilling to learn something new because she felt she ""wasn't smart enough"", despite her being smarter than most people I work with. If I try to re-assure her, she tends to brush it off or deny it. If I say she looks good, she would say ""no I don't"" and it seemed to just be completely rejected.

She frequently looks for re-assurance, which I can provide, but I personally find to be very strange. She'll ask ""do you still think I'm attractive?"" and my immediate thought is ""what changed that made you think I don't?"", it makes me feel like something I'm doing is wrong. Since I reassure her in the past and she rejects it, it makes me wonder if it ever really ""sinks in"" or if it's just dismissed out of hand so never reaches her

A lot of the time this just leads me to feel very frustrated. Like if she could just improve her confidence a little bit and be less neurotic about her insecurities, she could accomplish so much more -- to me it feels like an artificial limiter on her success. As an example, she quit power lifting because she ""felt like people were looking at her"", and I just thought that was both sad and frustrating because she was genuinely good at it and enjoyed it. And sometimes I just feel straight up annoyed with reassuring her. To me, it's like if she asked ""what's your favorite color?"" every day, and every day I say ""cyan"" then the next day she feels the compulsion to ask *just in case possibly I randomly changed my mind*. Sometimes I don't want to reassure

Be honest with the women. Once you get to know them, let them know what kind of upbringing you had and that you need patience and understanding. Don’t make sex a big emphasis in your relationships. Focus on being a good person. Kind, understanding, stand up for yourself. Communicate.

This is so rare that it really shouldn't even be brought up to begin with.

>why are more men than women still being promoted into senior roles

Because men are generally more willing to work 60 hour weeks, ask for promotions, prioritize their career, be more strict and straight forward, less agreeable, and so on. There are also more men in corporate workplaces while there are more women in family-oriented/hospitality workplaces.

None of these things are negative. There are biological differences between men and women, which should be celebrated and used to build each other up.

Also to share a personal story, I slept with my female manager a while back. She put in a good word for me when I asked for a promotion, but I never got it. A friend slept with the male CEO of the company she worked for and said about the same thing. It's incredibly rare for someone to be promoted *because* they slept with their boss, as there would need to be a damn good reason to promote them other than ""they're good in bed,"" lol. This isn't the 50's anymore, in corporate workplaces we need to provide a strong business case for why we promote someone. If we promote them over someone else for seemingly no good reason, there's a good chance all parties involved could get some flak.",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/pk314p/if_sleeping_with_your_boss_is_a_way_to_get_ahead/hc2u9k0/,Credible_Cognition,male

"You got the first part out of the way: acknowledging that you have an unhealthy obsession with someone whom you can't be in a relationship with.

From years of personal experience in similar situations as you, I found the ***only*** way I can get over a girl is by blocking all contact with her. You can 100% admit your feelings to her and let her know that you can't handle seeing her or talking to her without losing your mind, and that you need to work on yourself. Assuming she *is* a good friend, she should be understand and give you space. Or she'll confess her feelings for you too, but I'd say do not expect anything even close to that.

Next step is to find other girl(s). You won't feel better overnight. But get a dating app, go to a bar, go to a party, do something where you can meet women. Have a chat, go on a date, hook up, just do *something* with other girls. Eventually you'll forget about this girl.

I had a previous job where I was in a very similar situation as you - met an amazing girl with a very similar culture to myself, we clicked in every way, always had something to talk about, loved each other's company, and so on. We talked about a potential relationship but unfortunately she was about 5 years older and even though it wasn't much it was enough to put us in slightly different points of our lives. She wanted kids in the next couple years, I wanted them in about ten. The ***only*** reason we didn't work out was because of the age, which was ***really fucking annoying*** and difficult to handle because I started to find reasons to ignore the age difference, started to think about if I wanted kids in my mid 20's, all for her. In the end we became friends with benefits and practically fell in love with each other for a solid three months until I was promoted and transferred to a much higher position in another office. We both agreed from the get go that when that time came, we would cut out communication and build on ourselves. That's exactly what we did, and although it ***sucks ass***, I was able to move on and build myself up.

But speaking very generally:

&#x200B;

>First, do guys ever truly know what they want in a girl?

Sure, though this is highly dependent on the age and maturity of the guy in question.  At 17 years old most of us don't know our heads from a hole in the ground, at 27 most of us have a pretty good idea what we *don't* want, at 37 most of us have a pretty solid idea of what we not only want but need.  There are exceptions, of course, and I do know some fellas who had pinned down their exact desires at 18 and haven't wavered since, so your mileage may vary.

&#x200B;

>Second, do guys like to be pursued by girls or would they rather do the pursuing?

Ahhh, the thrill of the hunt.  This is also highly variable.  Some guys want to make the first, second, and third moves, others want you to tell them you're interested so they don't look a fool and get rejected.  Either way, you know what all guys like?  Someone who communicates honestly.  If you like someone, say so!  If you're interested in going to dinner with someone, let that be known!  The desire for an open and honest partner is fairly universal.

&#x200B;

>Third, I feel that girls can come to the conclusion of whether she and a guy would make a good pair for a relationship faster than a guy. Is that safe to say?

It is probably too hard to quantify this.  Anecdotally, we can all share stories about girls we know who thought they had a perfect match until things went sour 2 months in, and we can also all swap tales of guys who we laughed at for pointing at a girl one day and saying ""this is the girl I'm gonna marry""...right up until we were in his wedding party.  These things happen.  And they happen often enough that I don't think your assertion would hold up to scrutiny.

This means that you two understand how each other work, and that some of the little mysteries you fear he may discover are things he already knows exist.  (Trust me, he understands you may need to use the restroom at some point.)  

Waking up with a partner is a very intimate thing, and the special nature of doing so will override any of the less pleasant things like messy hair, etc.  Again this falls under the category of ""it's wonderful just to be with you,"" and is not something to get too anxious over.

"Am I reading this right, that you made it clear you just want to hook up, then after seeing them for a while you say you want to get more serious? Or are you saying if you want sex from the start you got it, but if you want a relationship from the start, you don't?

If it's the former then yeah what do you expect? Guy goes into it ***only*** wanting sex, and now the girl he's with says she wants more. Ghosting is an immature and pathetic way of ending a relationship, so I'm not defending that aspect at all.

If it's the latter, maybe take it slow instead of jumping into bed right away. Go out for coffee, then dinner, then a walk through the park, get to know each other and talk about your experiences and life stories and whatnot. Make him interested in *you*, not your body.

Also cut out the ""why do all men suck"" attitude. It's a huge turn off and I've been with absolutely gorgeous girls with great personalities who say something similar, and I immediately lose almost all my attraction to them. Yes, it's stupid when ***anyone*** tricks you into sleeping with them, and yes it's stupid when ***anyone*** cuts out all communication out of the blue, but if you're 23 and already have the attitude of ""holy shit guys get it together,"" you're going to have a rough life.

"Sure, growing up in an environment where people reinforce stereotypes is going to make it difficult to get yourself out of that mindset, I've been there. But it's something you *need* to do if you want to find a happy, productive relationship.

And it all depends on the guy. I personally generally have no problem hooking up with a girl then getting serious and building a relationship later on. My most recent relationship started with us two getting to know each other over a couple months, not doing anything sexual, and learning a lot about each other, what we're looking for and how we envision our futures. When we finally got in bed, it made the sex that much better and it strengthened our relationship that much more, because we were being intimate with someone who we both have really strong feelings and emotions for, instead of having fun with someone who we were both attracted to.

Not saying one way is right or one is wrong, just sharing how I view it. If you start with agreeing to just be friends with benefits, there should be zero expectations of it going further, even if you catch feelings. That's why I suggest starting slow, because you'll be able to learn about the guy and if you want a relationship with him or not before you agree on *not* being in a relationship.",/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/pgbhzn/why_are_men_like_this/hbc49rc/,Credible_Cognition,male

Here's the thing, self worth (or whatever you want to call it) doesn't come from the praise of others, sure it's nice but if you think yourself as high value then then praise doesn't matter. If you think yourself as low value then praise still wont help as it would probably be dismissed or make you feel uncomfortable.

"This is a tough one.  First of all, this thread consists of three types of responses:  those men who have never experienced anything like this in a marriage, those that have, and women.

Definitely ignore the group that have never experienced this.  They all have no clue what this is or means.

Here's my take on this -- from someone that lived through abuse for the majority of a 22 year marriage.  First (and most importantly) once this has happened, it gets progressively easier for it to happen again, then again, and etc. (Same goes for lying to one's spouse).  Second -- leaving your wife now for something a year ago is odd, so unless things are still bad, don't. Third -- you have a kid.  So do I.  I did the stupid thing that many do and stayed married because of the kid. Worst idea imaginable, as the damage being done over time in small doses is infinitely more harmful than a divorce.  Fourth -- if this ever happens again, you need to protect yourself and defend yourself.  The only way to stop it while happening for me was to physically restrain her (hold her down on the bed/couch/floor) or to hit back in an equal amount of force (which was never more than a single slap back and a very loud ""don't you swing at me"").

I imagine you are (like I was) easily able to physically overcome her or protect yourself.  That is all good, but never forget there are times when you have to sleep too.

Going the route of a restraining order if it happens again and you are on the path to the end, is a risky prospect.  The judge nearly laughed at me and said ""go get a divorce lawyer"".  He didn't give 2 shits about protecting me or my son, no matter how many times the cops had to come and take her away to the hospital for a short term lockdown.  There are still many who think that women cannot be a threat to men -- even judges.

Her blaming you is very typical, but even if the initial argument is ""your fault"", the getting physical is 100% her and her alone to blame.

After all of this....   If it ever happens again, you need to leave (or she does), forever.  Audio and video recordings are your friend here, and a must if she is smart enough to fight dirty in a divorce (mine wasn't, luckily).

It is either not going to happen again (great, for all concerned) or it will happen more and more frequently.  Don't let the latter happen.

Which is it? Are you hanging out or dating? I'll hang out with anyone, but if I'm planning ahead, dressing nice, paying attention to one person and they are not showing any interest in intimacy by date 3-4, I'm going to assume they are not interested in me and I'm moving on.

"Physical intimacy covers showing affection for one person exclusively. In addition to sex it covers little things like holding hands, cuddling, playing footsie, whatever. Is the most clear cut way to show that you have gone beyond merely enjoying someone's presence into desiring it.


Two to three dates without showing any intimacy would be about 2 or 3 months of you treating me as a friend that pays for our outings.

1) What are dates? Because I don't consider something like a party with a bunch of mutual friends to be a date. For me, dates are outings where you spend at least 2 hours one-on-one.

One of the things you will figure out quickly is that experienced women know they bodies and they know what they want. You need to **listen**, and be ready to try things you didn't know before. **Keep an open mind**, you may discover things you didn't know. You may also be able to do things that younger women usually don't want.

Having boundaries is fine; the most important thing is respect.

Use your youth at your advantage. Women of this experience know and expect you know less, but to have more juice.

">I'm not THAT handsome or good looking and I'm not someone who get's that kind of attention, care, affection, and lust that often.

Pretty much certain that women at this age don't really care about that anymore. As long as you are ok looking and take care of yourself, that should be enough. In other words, don't worry about that too much. Try to be presentable to her friends, if that ever happens.

Personally, I'd focus on making sure the experience is as pleasurable for her as possible. I was with my FWB for 2 years. We learned eachother's body, and I learned everything I could from her. She told me I was the best lover she ever had, and I knew I could make her cum like no one else. I took pride into it and it only made me want to be even better.

>Viagra and energy drink is out of the question tho. I don't want to mess with my bloodstream if it's not necessary.

I have other medications causing ED for me, so viagra was the solution. Energy drink was just something I did, but coffee and some carbs 30 min before you meet her would also go a long way.

>The not falling in love part will be a bit hard, since she's a really good woman, mother and just an all around good person. She herself said that she liked the night because she didn't expected the kind of care and attention what I gave her in bed when I pleasured her and that she doesn't have to ""work"" that much on my willy to get it up compared to older men.

Just be aware that love relationships like this are usually not viable; you are likely not at the same point in life than she is, so falling in love with her will likely hurt you both.
